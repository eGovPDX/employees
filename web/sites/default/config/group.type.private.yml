description: 'A <em>Restricted group</em> requires a group admin to invite members. Only assigned editors and admins can create and edit content within the group. Membership will cause the group to appear in "my groups" for members of the group. Public records law applies to restricted groups. The restricted setting is to reduce clutter for groups that need to store content intended for a limited audience.'
