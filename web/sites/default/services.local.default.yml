# Local services, default version
#
# This is the default version of the services.local.yml file, which replicates produciton settings.
# The services.local.yml file is used when running the site locally, but it is not managed 
# in source control. To run the site locally in production mode, make a copy of this file and
# rename it services.local.yml. To run the site locally in development mode (caching off, debug on,
# etc.), make a copy of services.local.dev.yml and rename it services.local.yml.
