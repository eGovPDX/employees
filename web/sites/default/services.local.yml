# Local services, development version
#
# This is the development version of the services.local.yml file, which enables various development
# settings. It is not managed in source control. To run the site in development mode, make a copy 
# of this file and rename it services.local.yml. To run the site locally in production mode (caching 
# on, debug off, etc.), make a copy of services.local.default.yml and rename it services.local.yml.
