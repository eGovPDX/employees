<p><em>By Alain Labreque</em></p>
<p>My Granddaughter Myka is a beautiful, intelligent, 8-year-old child, and she is disabled. She has been in physical, occupational, and speech therapies since she was 7 months old. After years of tests, MRI&rsquo;s, and meetings with developmental and neurological specialists, she and her mother (my daughter in law) were diagnosed with a genetic abnormality. She has a deleted gene. It is a very rare condition. In some cases, the person would never know that they have this condition. In Myka, the symptoms are more obvious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deleted gene is most impactful on the brain. It impacts motor functions in her brain which then relates to basically everything she does, both gross or fine motor. This impacts walking, running, jumping, but also reading, writing, talking. In addition, Myka has low muscle tone which also impacts all her motor functions.</p>
<p>Myka did not crawl as baby until she was 15 months old. She worked with a physical therapist for one and a half years to accomplish what most babies do in 5 months. From there, Myka was able to walk at 2 years old. She is now able to walk and run, but she is working on the ability to jump or hop. The two combined muscle issues cause Myka to easily lose her balance and she trips and falls more than a typical child.</p>
<p>The deleted gene also effects the neuropathways. Myka is neurodivergent, she gets overwhelmed in loud noisy spaces, she retreats when surrounded by crowds, she has difficulty focusing on tasks, and she has difficulty regulating her behavior when she is tired or overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The most obvious of Myka&rsquo;s symptoms is her speech. Myka is non-verbal. She can sign a few words, but her neuropathways do not always find the right word. The muscles that we use to speak have not been fully trained for her to easily voice her words. She can say a few words that are perfectly clear but for the most part she can&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>Myka is intelligent, she has learned to communicate by a combination of saying the few words she can say, sign language, and pointing at what she needs. She has taken me by the hand to lead me to a picture of juice to show me what she wants. Myka is extraordinary and does not often get frustrated by her situation. Life is more difficult for her in all aspects, and she accepts that and tries her best to overcome her obstacles. Everything a neurotypical child does takes Myka 10X the effort. Neurotypical people do not consider that aspect in working with those who are differently abled.</p>
<p>I am describing Myka&rsquo;s condition because it is complicated and not fully defined by modern medicine. When one looks at Myka one would see a very happy child. She has enormous blue eyes and light brown curly hair. She is usually smiling. Her disability is not visually apparent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Myka&rsquo;s classmates accept Myka for who she is. They do not judge her and they usually help her throughout the day. Unfortunately, the sad part of Myka&rsquo;s story is how adults dismiss her when they learn she has a disability. I have witnessed people calling on Myka to participate in an activity, find out she is non-verbal and instantly dismiss her.</p>
<p>Myka has dealt with adults who talk about her while she is standing next to them hearing everything they say. Adults seem to think that because she can&rsquo;t talk then she also can&rsquo;t hear their unkind comments. Her differences have been pointed out to her classmates as if she should be ostracized. &ldquo;Oh look she doesn&rsquo;t even say Hi.&rdquo; I cannot begin to describe the heartbreak and fury I feel when these things happen. She has a slightly crestfallen look on her face as she tries her best and more to keep up but knows she is somehow different.</p>
<p>One day at the end of the school year, my daughter got a notice that Myka&rsquo;s class was putting on a show during their Friday assembly. Myka was expected to participate in the show. We knew that Myka might have an issue with the crowds, and we didn&rsquo;t know if she would be able to participate in the event. &nbsp;Earlier in the year, she went on a field trip with her class to see a show. She ended up sitting outside the show because she was getting overwhelmed. We worried about her participating in this school event.</p>
<p>We all walked Myka to school to support her during the performance. Her 4-year-old brother was very excited to see Myka. We made our way to the assembly and anxiously waited for the show to start. The class came in and they were all carrying signs with various animals on them. Myka was positioned surrounded by her classmates and her Special Education teacher (known as Ms Q) was right behind her. She was happily looking around at the crowds and was very relaxed. Seeing that Myka was happy we all relaxed to enjoy the show.</p>
<p>The show was children singing and waving their animal signs. At certain points in the show, sets of children would run up on stage to play xylophones to accompany the singing. Myka was happily singing and standing in her spot. She was included in the group. The show was long, the children were singing and playing the xylophone, and the music teacher was running from one set of children to the other. It was chaotic, and Myka was enjoying it. She did not falter, and she did not get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the show, we noticed that Myka was not in her spot. I worried that she got upset and needed to be removed. Suddenly, we saw Myka walk on the stage with Ms Q. She sat down to play the xylophone, just like her classmates. She had a huge smile on her face and was clearly enjoying every minute. I cried at seeing her be able to participate as much as her classmates.</p>
<p>At the end of the show, we stayed behind to say hello to Myka and tell her we are so proud of her. She hugged us all and was especially happy to see that her baby brother got to see her. Myka was clearly very proud of herself and so happy to fully participate, she was glowing.</p>
<p>Ms. Q was with Myka the whole time. Ms. Q and said she really wanted Myka have the full experience. Ms. Q had arranged special rehearsal sessions for Myka to practice going on stage. She and the children worked with Myka so she understood what was expected and how it felt to be on stage. They took the extra step to include her and worked with her until she was comfortable going in front of a group of people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to pin down how this inclusion influences someone. Myka has gained confidence this year and I believe the extra effort to include her is partly why. Myka is trying more and more to say words, and her vocabulary is growing. She went to a summer camp daycare and participated in a song and dance show. One of the daycare teachers taught her some basic sign language and she is using that to communicate. She was included in a way that didn&rsquo;t emphasize her differences but simply accepted her for who she is. That inclusion increased her confidence to keep trying new things.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I ask that you think to yourself. Have I taken any extra steps to include anyone who is outside of my circle including different abilities, different cultures, or any other difference? Have I unceremoniously dismissed someone who may need additional support to perform a task? Have I unconsciously talked about someone (usually a child) believing that they don&rsquo;t understand or hear me? We are all beautifully different humans, and we all deserve to be treated with respect and given opportunities to be included. I have witnessed the positive effects and I vow to follow the example shown to me. Please join me.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/812522

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br /> </span></strong><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Part Three of Three </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What can you do to help </span></strong><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Autists participate?</span></strong><ins datetime=""2023-06-23T15:21"" cite=""mailto:Massenburg,%20Julian""></ins></p>
<p>My suggestions here will largely focus on the formal settings, and a lot of the adjustments that came with the response to the pandemic have addressed these and opened different ways to work. &nbsp;The overall theme of this section will boil down to one thing &ndash; be flexible in how you allow others to show up.</p>
<p>Virtual meetings often make the pace of meetings easier to process. There is often a slight delay in someone else adding to a conversation, either due to coming off mute or waiting to be acknowledged by the person running the meeting. Virtual meetings allow for an individual to have a bit more control of their environment, like using a focus room as a physical space to attend the meeting. It also makes contributing easier as people can type in responses or raise hands to not interrupt. <br /> <br /> Virtual meetings also have downsides. In team settings where multiple people are on a virtual meeting while sitting next to each other, it can cause a lot of audio processing issues as you can end up with three audio steams of one person talking (e.g., person talking in the room, their audio on Teams, and their audio coming through someone else&rsquo;s mic who are not on mute). In these settings, consider moving the team to a conference room with the option to attend virtually if someone needs it.</p>
<p>I have also seen a lot of people discuss pushing for people to turn on cameras to make sure they engage with the discussion more. And while this can be true for allistic extroverts, it can have the opposite impact for Autists. Having a camera on can distract us from the meeting as we suddenly have an increased pressure to mask and appear as if we are focused instead of doing what allows us to actually focus. This can lead to lower contribution rate as we are more aware of the camera than the meeting. But even asking for people to turn on cameras , if comfortable, can cause Autists to turn on cameras when they aren&rsquo;t comfortable in an attempt to mask as it appears expected. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what type of meeting you are in create space for contribution. From my experience, people in BTS are pretty good about this already &ndash; but I still want to bring this up. It is always good to check if anyone else wants to add something to a topic before moving on from it, and actually give a pause for them to chime in. I have worked with multiple companies that do more of a &ldquo;and if no one has anything else to say moving on to&hellip;&rdquo; and continue right into the next topic, forcing someone to interrupt if they want to speak. This is something that many Autists are not comfortable doing because of rules they were taught earlier in life. Teams makes this a bit easier with the ability to raise a hand, or type in the chat. I often raise a hand even in person because it is just easier even if it feels a bit odd.</p>
<p>As for the informal, I wish I had more tips on this as this is something I continue to work on myself and hear many other Autists struggle with. A big part of this is not felling like we can be ourselves and the need to mask to be present in these settings. Many Autists report they find friendship and social interactions to just be easier with other neurodivergent people. However, I can say if you want to include Autists in something, you need to explicitly invite them. Many Autists joke that we are like vampires, we can&rsquo;t come in unless invited. Saying things like, &ldquo;A bunch of us are going to go grab lunch from the food carts.&rdquo; may be received as just the sharing of information instead of the intended invitation. So, making sure to add the explicit invitation, &ldquo;Would you like to join us?&rdquo; afterward will clarify that you are inviting them.</p>
<p>I have heard several Autists discuss activity-based events being easier to attend, and this is certainly true for myself. It is much easier to go to something knowing that there is a specific thing I am there to do, and I can make an informed decision if it is something I want to go to. Just having a social get together with a group is extremely vague, often has no specific end time, and is often based solely around conversation. For me this is one of the reasons I love board games and was very active with the Oregon Bartenders&rsquo; Guild. Both provide me chances to socialize with a specific interest as the focal point if it is needed and I can gauge how long I am going to be there before going. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a great way to close this out other than to say thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Thank you for contributing to our organization being one that is open and accepting of people with different backgrounds, experience, and ability. If you want to learn more some really good resources exist in social media and advocacy networks. If on Instagram lookup @nourdivergent_lou for some quick insight from an Autist and educator on many specific topics and experiences.

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">See disclaimer in Part 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Communication in one-on-one settings</span></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Growing up we are taught to sit still and make eye contact to show we are listening and give a firm handshake when meeting someone. For Autists these things can be harmful. Autists often don&rsquo;t pick up on body language and looking someone in the eye can be physically uncomfortable for them. Some are very sensitive of personal space and having a hand thrust out for a handshake can feel like an attack.</p>
<p>Being allowed to position ourselves how we need in a conversation can allow us to give attention to the person speaking and put us at ease. This can be as minor as looking at the ground, or as major as turning away from the speaker. Keep in mind that someone does not need to be looking at you to hear you. Look for other ways of confirming you are being heard and understood.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Communication breakdowns</span></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how often I walk away from a conversation wondering if I was having the same conversation as the person I was talking to. I often find that I&rsquo;ll say something and later find out a person took a whole different meaning from it than what was said. Autists often report communicating in literal terms. Something I find is often useful in explaining this experience is connotation versus denotation.</p>
<p>Connotation is the inferred meaning often relying on context or societal norms and can often have nothing to do with the dictionary definition of the meaning.</p>
<p>Denotation is the dictionary definition of something. It has a specific, literal meaning. Now, most Autists don&rsquo;t go and read through a dictionary, but I know for myself when I come across a word I don&rsquo;t know, the first thing I do is look it up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, this leads to a lot of confusion. I might be having a conversation, speaking in denotation and understanding in denotation, but the person I am talking to has a completely different understanding of things because they are using all the connotations of their lived experience. I will say I greatly appreciate Speed of Trust&rsquo;s point of Talk Straight for this very reason and struggle a lot with that kind of bloated corporate speak where everything is masked in vague aggrandized terms. This all extends to things like sarcasm, colloquialisms, and jokes.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Sarcasm</span></p>
<p>Very interesting thing within Autists. I am, and know several others, that are often very sarcastic, and yet tend to be pretty bad at picking up on other&rsquo;s sarcasm. This has a lot to do with learning sarcasm as part of scripting, but not understanding body language and tone enough to pick up on it from others. This can become even worse in forms of written communication where there are no context clues for me to try and piece together.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Colloquialisms</span></p>
<p>Many phrases that are used regularly make absolutely no sense or are straight horrifying when read through the lens of denotation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining cats and dogs,&rdquo; what a horrifying statement. Now for myself I have learned to process this phrase for its connotation of &ldquo;its heavily raining outside,&rdquo; but my mind has to hear the phrase, process that there are not literal cats and dogs falling from the sky (and suppress the emotional response to how awful of an event this would be), and finally recall the meaning of this phrase. While all of that happens in a matter of a second, doing this throughout a day can cause mental fatigue. Many Autists will learn, and even use, these phrases as part of masking and scripting. But they will still have internal thoughts of how ridiculous the phrases are or must exert extra energy to redirect their speech to use them.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Jokes</span></p>
<p>Some Autists struggle to understand jokes, or our audio processing (or extra time to process connotation) leads us to get the joke much later. I often find myself saying something funny and not even processing that it is a joke in the context of a conversation until people laugh, I repeat what I said in my head, and piece together why that was funny after something else that had already been said. I have found when in groups of Allistics I will even need to ask what the joke was, in doing this have found I often enjoy jokes that can be explained around their word play or being about going against an expectation. On the other hand, I have found many people can get angry or uncomfortable being asked to explain a joke &ndash; as it shows the joke was in bad taste. Part of Autists masking can often be laughing along at jokes that are not understood or make them uncomfortable. None of this is to say Autists do not have good senses of humor, I especially love puns and word play and Hannah Gadsby (another Autist) is one of my favorite comedians. &nbsp;Scripting also makes it fairly easy for Autists to be funny as they learn comedic timing and how to respond to phrases or situations from TV shows and movies. <br /> <br /> <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Communication in group settings</span></strong></p>
<p>Communication in group settings can be extremely difficult for Autists. Trying to keep up with a conversation between multiple people while dealing with audio processing issues is enough of a challenge, but it also takes quite a good deal of energy and focus to be able to participate in those settings. &nbsp;Autists are often dealing with sensory overload, audio processing difficulties, translating connotations to denotations, trying to time when they can speak while adhering to societal things like not interrupting or speaking over someone else, and often masking behaviors of their own to make everyone in the conversation more comfortable.</p>
<p>Sensory overload presents in different ways for Autists. It could be something as minor as getting a new shirt that is a slightly different material than what they are used to, and it is causing a sensation as drastic as feeling like something is scraping over their skin. Sensory overload could also include lights in the room are too bright, or the sound of the projector in a room is being picked up at an equal level as the person speaking, or the scent of a team members perfume/cologne can be smelled from across the room (even though no one else notices it). I find this especially difficult in settings with multiple conversations. I&rsquo;ve noticed I can hear conversations in a group to the side more clearly than the person I am speaking one-on-one with. Another big one for me is ticking clocks. If there is an analog clock in a room, I can hear it like it is right next to my ear - making it almost impossible for me to focus on other things.</p>
<p>All of these sensory inputs can make it hard to focus. Even when able to focus, attempting to process audio between everyone in a group conversation can take a while. By the time I process what is said, think about it, and have an opinion or response, I appear slow to respond to things. Add in the effort on my part to adhere to social etiquette and not interrupt or talk over someone, I will often miss a chance to speak. In a work setting, this often has me drafting an email to send to the relevant party after a meeting is over. In a less formal setting like a team lunch I am often left to not engage, or risk saying something on a topic that people moved on from several minutes ago. I will often find myself seeking one-on-one conversation in these environments for this reason and look for physical spots to isolate myself from the majority of the group conversations &ndash; corners of rooms or corners of tables are good for this.</p>
<p>As an aside, as part of my ASD I really like structure. Having rules and frameworks with reasons behind them allow me to know expectations of behavior and know that I am behaving correctly. One of the frameworks I use in communication is called the four gates, this comes out of a Sufi teaching. Before I speak, I try to take what I am saying through four questions. These are: <ins datetime=""2023-06-23T15:20"" cite=""mailto:Massenburg,%20Julian""></ins></p>
<ol>
<li>Is what I have to say true?</li>
<li>Does this need to be said/does this need to be said by me?</li>
<li>Is now the appropriate time to say this?</li>
<li>Is what I am saying kind?</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules help me reframe a lot of what I say, but also cause a further delay in conversation and make every effort to communicate expend more mental energy.</p>
<p>Many Autists operate off the rules they have been taught growing up. These can include things that aren&rsquo;t very supportive of getting involved in a conversation and can take a lot of work for Autists to reframe their rules. These can influence behaviors like remaining quite in group conversations or speaking bluntly and coming off as rude. This can also leave us in a state of confusion as we interact with people that don&rsquo;t follow the rules we have been taught. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treat others the way you want to be treated</li>
<li>Honesty is the best policy</li>
<li>Wait for your turn to speak/ don&rsquo;t interrupt others</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t speak unless spoken to</li>
</ul>
<p>Many Autists find it easier to communicate with other Autists because the others involved are using similar rules. They are able to speak bluntly without the other person taking offense, able to establish trust much quicker as both parties speak honestly, and are often more comfortable in the silence after conversation has ended.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/812462

I will largely be speaking from my own experiences, but I will also try to expand on topics with things I have heard while speaking with others in the community. I will be focusing on this from the perspective of Autists (Autistic people) who are capable of verbal communication, there are many people on the spectrum who are nonverbal and use augmented and alternative communication. It is important to note these demographics exist and are just as relevant, but as I do not have experience with this to speak from, I will not be covering it here.</p>
<p>I have not been officially diagnosed with ASD, as the way it presents for me caused me to excel in a school environment. Many people go undiagnosed, especially women and people of color, as most research on autism has been done on white males with behaviors that were found disruptive to the allistic world. Many people in the Autistic community self-diagnose for this reason and the community acknowledges and respects self-diagnosis. It was not until my late 20&rsquo;s that I heard from enough Autists to realize several of the things I experience are not neurotypical experiences, and only after several years of reading about Autists&rsquo; experiences, did I start to identify as Autistic.</p>
<p>The focus of this blog post will be on communication, specifically in work environments. It is important to keep in mind that there is no one size fits all way of handling communication, and it is important to create space to establish how to best communicate with someone.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What is Autism</span></strong><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</span></strong><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">? </span></strong><br /> <br /> ASD is the medical term used for a wide range of what the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) calls, &lsquo;neurodevelopmental disorders&rsquo; that can impact an individual&rsquo;s functions including: communication, sensory processing, executive function, and more. While it is often framed negatively, &nbsp;this is largely due to a history of ableism in the medical field and a focus on deficits rather than an understanding of function. The Autistic community continues to try and reframe these things with perspective of Autists, to give a better understanding of how we function in a world that is not designed for us, rather than looking for lack of ability.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Autists see examples of Autists throughout history and as far back as ancient Egypt. Current research suggests ASD is an inherited genetic trait and has existed for a long time. Due to the limited way it was studied it went largely undiagnosed and misrepresented for much of recent history. Current understanding of it has rates of diagnosis increasing drastically making some people point to modern day environmental factors as the cause. This simply is not true; ASD is just becoming easier to diagnose and acceptance of it is growing so we are seeing the actual numbers for the first time.</p>
<p>Many of the terms used in diagnosing people with ASD are outdated, have ableist mind sets behind them, and were established by people with horrible ethical practices. It is important to understand that each person may prefer different language around being Autistic. I will be referring to myself as Autistic throughout this, but keep in mind some may not like being referred to in that way, and it is best to use the language someone prefers. If you want to read about why I choose to identify as Autistic rather than as someone with autism, there is a fantastic article on the use of identity-first language instead of person-first language on the <a href=""https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/identity-first-language/"">Autistic Self Advocacy Network&rsquo;s website</a>. <br /> <br /> While I will talk about a lot of different behaviors, it is important to note that autism can be very polarizing in how it presents and can even show both extremes in a single person depending on the situation. Eye contact is a good example. In certain situations, a person may not be able to make any eye contact, while that same person in a different situation makes the most intense eye contact. For me &ndash; I struggle to make eye contact while thinking or processing information.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to introduce you to some terms before I dive further into the topic of communication. These are some terms that are used in the Autistic community around specific behaviors we often exhibit and tactics we have for interacting with people in an allistic world. While I may not talk about these directly while discussing communication, it is important to keep them in mind as they are things Autists may do/use when communicating with others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Masking </span></strong></p>
<p>This is any behavior that an Autist does to hide who they are or how they behave normally in order to pass as neurotypical. Some of us are better at it than others and it takes different amounts of energy depending on the person and the situation they are in.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Scripting</span></strong></p>
<p>Scripting is a common thing among the Autistic community and one of several things used in masking. Just like one would rehearse for a play we learn lines for specific situations. I worked as a bartender for eight years and scripting is what made that possible. I watched how the senior staff initiated conversations, how they responded to requests, how they cut people off, and how they closed people&rsquo;s tabs out. &nbsp;I did better in formal bars than dives because I could hide behind that script more. We may partake in scripted conversation even though it bothers us. A common example of this scenario in the Autistic community is asking, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; Then there is an expectation to say, &ldquo;Fine thanks, how are you?&rdquo; We often go through the script instead of sharing how we feel, even if it bothers us to run through these kinds of surface level dialogues as we want to share, or we struggle to understand the point of the question.</p>
<p>Scripting comes from all kinds of sources: people we are close to, coworkers, tv, movies, books, complete strangers at the checkout stand in a grocery store. Some Autists will seem particularly outgoing because they excel at scripting and have learned exaggerated ways of being or doing things from tv and movies. If you have ever seen the HBO series <em>The Rehearsal</em>, scripting is kind of like that. Every conversation I have; I go over what I said, how the person reacted, and if there was a different way I could have said it. All that so I can have a better script for the next time that situation comes up.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Echolalia</span></strong></p>
<p>This is a particularly interesting one to me and a word I enjoy a lot. Echolalia is the behavior of repeating sounds or phrases. At home I do this aloud, a lot. In public it is often an internal monologue. This is something that has dual function for me, it either brings me joy as I repeat interesting words or phrases, or it is used as a tool to help me process a sound or information. In conversations, I will frequently pair it with a, &ldquo;Sorry, what was that?&rdquo; to allow myself time to process internally what they originally said while the person repeats themselves. For other Autists, this may include repeating a word at the end of a sentence, repeating back what was said to them, or just speaking something repeatedly. <br /> <br /> <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Stimming</span></strong></p>
<p>This is an important one to know as it is often the most observable. This is something many neurodivergent people do to ground themselves, focus, release energy, or stay present. It is often seen as fidgeting and has endless ways of presenting. For me, I often tap my thumb to my fingertips or tap the side of my thumb on my desk or keyboard. For others, it may come as rubbing a shirt, twirling their hair, bouncing their leg, or jerking their body. While this kind of behavior is often seen as disruptive it is tremendously helpful for many of us to stay present in meetings, focus on tasks, and remain comfortable in environments with a lot of sensory input. <br /> <br /> <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Infodumping</span></strong></p>
<p>Autists often have hyper fixations &ndash; which is a particular category or topic they are really interested in that they could talk passionately about for a long time. They are often excited when an opportunity to speak about this comes up and may begin sharing a lot without much room for others to add to the conversation. This is commonly referred to as infodumping. When you see someone go from disengaged in a conversation to dominating a conversation you may have discovered one of their hyper fixations. These topics can and will often change for people over time and can last anywhere from a day to a lifetime. The excitement of these topics will often lead us to break social etiquette we may otherwise try really hard to follow, like jumping into a conversation and talking over someone to share a fact we find really cool. It is often these hyper fixations that leave people with ASD uninterested in small talk as they want to get into the gritty details of things they are excited for, or something someone else is excited about. These can be on any category, but because of the flawed research that has been done there is an assumption these will be on categories like trains (many of the medical diagnostics used will actually ask if someone likes trains). Some people&rsquo;s hyper fixations will be much more socially acceptable than others, increasing the ease of which they can mask.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/812461
BTS Blog,812421,Tilde,1,,2023-07-11 23:53:27 UTC,2023-06-13 16:13:00 UTC,A,The Expedition to the Exhibition of Gender Identity,"<h2>By Tom Lupton</h2>
<h2><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=812415"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""312.5"" /></h2>
<h2>The idea</h2>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not here at work helping transform our beloved city&rsquo;s business strategies into working services, I&rsquo;m a fashion photographer and artist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share with you a memorable event &ndash; one where I learned some amazing things about people and about myself.</p>
<p>In February 2020 (yeah, right before the pandemic), Portland Center Stage asked me to do an exhibit to coincide with the punk rock opera <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Hedwig and the Angry Inch</span>. Decades earlier my theater nerd friends had turned me on to the show with its gut-wrenching passion and outlandish in-your-face fashion escapades, so I jumped at the chance!</p>
<p>After a few fits and starts about the exhibit's theme - drag queen style, disguise, transformation - I realized it needed <em>reality</em> to make it meaningful.</p>
<p>So I whipped open Facebook and posted, &ldquo;I am doing a new exhibit, and I&rsquo;m looking for LGBTQ+ people to shoot&rdquo;. Within moments I had various reactions of &ldquo;like&rdquo; and &ldquo;love&rdquo; and ""pick me"". I thought &ldquo;Ah heck this could turn into a nightmare&rdquo; and edited the post saying, &ldquo;this IS NOT a fashion shoot &ndash; it might not be pretty or beautiful&rdquo;. I stepped away for a while wondering if I&rsquo;d made the right decision, and came back to a flood of volunteers.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Be you, but be as you as you can be&rdquo;.</h2>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=812416"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""312.5"" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I wear? What should I bring?&rdquo; they asked. This was the crucial point of the whole process. Do I control it, or do I relinquish control and capture what I see? In a large project like this, it&rsquo;s usually extremely important to control it for consistency and quality. I remembered how important reality was to this project though, and made a commitment to honor whatever they gave me.</p>
<p>I knew close to nothing about the community I had enlisted. If I had choregraphed the shoot, I would have attempted to &ldquo;shoot them <em>as I saw </em>them&rdquo; which sounds really noble, but I would have injected bits of me into it -- intentionally or not. So I asked them to be themselves &ndash; but be as much themselves as they possibly could. I have a penchant for making ridiculous statements like that.</p>
<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=812417"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""295.94554602"" /></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know many of the people who showed up. I was suspicious that some of them were there to get a free professional portrait. There was a huge variety of people &ndash; some that looked to be as young as twelve; some looked to be close to seventy. Some came in drag, some with studded harnesses, some conventional, and even one with alien eyes.</p>
<p>As I shot, I listened. And what I heard was not what I was shooting. No one was what I thought my eyes and my camera told me. A bearded man who came in with his strikingly beautiful wife used to be a woman. The gender-fluid fashion model. The happily married gay soccer mom. The person born with both sets of plumbing, who doesn&rsquo;t give a hoot what gender people think they are. As each person left I realized I could not assume who the next person would be. And that constantly trying to fit their narratives into something familiar and conventional tired me out. So I stopped trying.</p>
<h2>Tilde</h2>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=812418"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""312.5"" /></p>
<p>Back at work after that weekend, I was typing up business requirements, something like &ldquo;must support ~8,000 users&rdquo;. I use that squiggle a lot &ndash; called a <em>tilde.</em> It means approximately, or more or less. It&rsquo;s the typographical equivalent of waving your hands in the air. As I looked at the tilde I nodded sagely, patted my monitor bezel, and thanked it for naming the exhibit: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Tilde</span>.</p>
<p>The title made each and every person&rsquo;s story in the exhibit make perfect sense. No one is a deviation from the norm. If everyone is a tilde, there can be no absolute. We don&rsquo;t have to struggle to fit their story into something we&rsquo;re comfortable with if we <em>just listen and accept their story</em>. That inspired me to print out the hundred or so images and tape them to the exhibit wall. as is -- instead of the usual standardized framing. I&rsquo;d gone this far without &ldquo;packaging&rdquo; them, and it seemed like the perfect final act of rebellion.</p>

BTS Blog,812258,CGIS Staff Attends ESRI Developer Summit,1,,2023-05-12 15:32:56 UTC,2023-05-12 15:30:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=812257"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""250"" /></em></p>
<p><em>By Diego Portillo</em></p>
<p>The<a href=""https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit/overview"" target=""_blank"">&nbsp;Esri Developer Summit (DevSummit)</a>&nbsp;is an annual event&nbsp;&ldquo;For Developers, By Developers&rdquo; that brings together software engineers, data scientists, and other professionals from around the world to learn, collaborate, and explore the latest developments in GIS technology. The summit takes place in March, on average more than 1,000 attendees from hundreds of public and private organizations as well as industries, have the opportunity to attend over 150 technical sessions, workshops, and hands-on training sessions, as well as engage with&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.esri.com/en-us/home"" target=""_blank"">Esri</a>&nbsp;experts and industry leaders. The conference showcases the latest GIS applications, tools, and services, providing attendees with insights into how GIS is being used.</p>
<p>Overall, the Esri DevSummit is a valuable event for anyone working in GIS development or interested in learning about the latest trends and innovations in GIS technology. It provides attendees with an opportunity to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field, as well as to connect with peers and experts in the industry. It has been several years since anyone form the CGIS team attended the summit, and we were able to take advantage of our Enterprise License Agreement with Esri and send 4 people.</p>
<p>They comeback with great insights of current GIS applications and uses, but also, and most importantly, with knowledge of what is coming up, what are the trends, Esri&rsquo;s roadmap and vision. This information will be used to adjust the City of Portland GIS Geospatial Strategy.</p>
<p>Kellie Gulden: &ldquo;ESRI continues to consolidate their mobile form app, ArcGIS Field Maps. Field Maps allows data capture and editing by streamlining critical workflows. Moving forward, ESRI is adding the ability to configure tasks with JSON and Arcade, reducing the complexity of creating and maintaining forms. Through Smart Camera Assistance, ESRI is integrating machine learning with images, and prepopulating attributes therefore reducing personnel time spent with data collection.</p>
<p>ESRI is adding a range of spatial analysis capabilities into the Map Viewer (browser based) providing the ability to combine data including Big Data with powerful analytical processing &ndash; reducing barriers to better understand data. This is the heart of GIS, and ESRI is increasing accessibility to technology and data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek Miller: &ldquo;Esri&rsquo;s proprietary expression language &ndash; Arcade &ndash; continues to gain traction throughout the ArcGIS system. Arcade allows developers to write lightweight, portable expressions that enhance or extend core functionality. These expressions can then be applied throughout ArcGIS applications, including custom applications developed with the ArcGIS &nbsp;Maps SDK for Javascript. Arcade executes within <em>profiles</em> (think scope) that define the functionality exposed within a given context. Recent updates to the <em>Form Constraint</em> profile (feature editing) and multiple profiles exposed in the ArcGIS Dashboards product may provide enhanced functionality to our users.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aaron Kilbey: &ldquo;The selection of web technologies for the front-end of the most recent version of PortlandMaps was a long and hard road circa 2014, most particularly because the ESRI JavaScript API which handles the spatial component, the map, and the evaluated CSS and JavaScript frameworks, the user-interface surrounding the map, at the time all had many difficulties participating together harmoniously to produce a responsive and universally accessible web application, such that quite a bit of code had to be written to make them play nicely together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a newer version of PortlandMaps I&rsquo;m trying to determine the best course forward with the currently available technologies, and, the thing at the Dev Summit that most piqued my interest was a product called Calcite.&nbsp; The term itself has been around for years as the name of the theming system for ESRI Javascript API widgets, but, it has matured to the point that, as of January 2023, it has been released as a full-fledged CSS and Javascript framework.&nbsp; Upon initial evaluation it contains all of the major capabilities and components that would be crucial if we were to extract our current solutions for CSS, JavaScript widgets and icons.&nbsp; In theory, as this product has matured while always being bound to the ESRI JavaScript API map, it will seamlessly integrate with it, reducing the need for go-between code, while opening up potential deeper integration between the aspatial UI presentation layer and the map.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, there was particular emphasis in Calcite sessions placed on the widescale efforts that ESRI took with the product in regard to accessibility and design, two communities that traditionally seemed underrepresented, and two of the most essential things to &ldquo;get right&rdquo; for modern web interfaces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mike Quetel: &ldquo;Portland has a large and busy deployment of ArcGIS Server, the engine behind PortlandMaps, MapWorks and many online maps, apps and dashboards.&nbsp; This deployment&nbsp; has grown substantially over the last few years and we expect the trend to continue.&nbsp; As such CGIS keeps an eye on future offerings that may help us manage and scale to customer and project needs more effectively.</p>
<p>A new and exciting offering from Esri is a cloud native version of ArcGIS Server, built using Kubernetes and designed for deployment on Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and others.&nbsp; Kubernetes &ldquo;containerizes&rdquo; data services and applications so that they may scale dynamically as demand ebbs and flows, while maintaining isolation from other workloads. Containers also tend to be relatively standalone. This means that dependencies exist within the container itself, easing the process of deployment from DEV, to TEST and finally into PROD.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll continue to monitor this product&rsquo;s evolution and how it may help us deliver additional value to customers going forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you noticed more maps and people in the Portland Building recently, it&rsquo;s because the 31<sup>st</sup> annual <a href=""https://www.orurisa.org/GISinAction"">GIS in Action Conference</a> was held in the Portland Building during the week of April 17th. This conference is hosted by the <a href=""http://www.orurisa.org/"">Oregon URISA Chapter</a> and the&nbsp;Cascadia Region&nbsp;chapter of the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (<a href=""https://www.asprs.org/"">ASPRS</a>). The conference had over 200 registered attendees and an additional 50 volunteers, and professional sponsors. In addition, the conference offered day-long training workshops and provided over 50 presentations on various topics such as GIS Collaboration, Imagery Advancements, GIS Solutions for Public Utilities, and various technology focused presentations.</p>
<p>Team members from the Corporate GIS Team and other staff throughout the City of Portland helped coordinate, gave presentations, and volunteered their time to make this conference successful. Diego Portillo (CGIS Manager) championed the conference and coordinated with OMF Facilities to reserve the public spaces on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> floor, coordinated the volunteers, and worked tirelessly before, after, and throughout the conference. Andrew Neuman (CGIS) also served on the planning committee and volunteered throughout the conference. Tommy Dong (CGIS) created the fantastic maps and signage that helped attendees navigate the building. Finally, James Apple (IS Manager, Communications) and his team provided technical support for all of the AV and computer needs for the conference, and we were so thankful for their assistance. Special thanks goes also to Kathy Thielen from Facilities Services for her patience and support getting the building ready, and last but not least, Jonah Willbach and all the 311 team that shared the front desk. We couldn&rsquo;t have done this without everyone&rsquo;s support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Former Governor John Kitzhaber delivered the keynote address and spoke to the theme of the conference of Interconnectedness to share stories on how GIS Technology can be utilized to help resolve issues such as houselessness and mitigation of wildfires.</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=812162"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""368.949771689"" /></p>
<p>The city had a very visible presence with its numerous volunteers and presenters from BTS, BES, PBOT, Water, and Planning and Sustainability. They delivered presentations showing the great work we do here at the City of Portland in GIS, data analysis, and visualization.</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=812163"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""386.521308226"" /></p>
<p>Finally, our very own CTO, Jeff Baer, delivered the closing keynote, sharing how vital GIS and maps are in our culture and how embedded GIS is in the City of Portland. In addition, Jeff provided some great examples of some of the work where GIS is used to help drive business decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=812169"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""386.639676113"" /></p>

<p>On March 23, just over 40 people braved the cold, rainy weather (even by bike) to meet up at the Multnomah French Quarter for the 2023 BTS Spring Social. This unique food cart pod is on the west side of Portland, not too far from the Multnomah Arts Center and was designed to feel like the village square where the owner grew up in France. We took advantage of both the indoor and outdoor seating areas, enjoyed some delicious food cart items (some of us had dessert for dinner) and had a great time connecting with each other. There was even some cribbage playing at one point.</p>
<p>We also had a raffle... pulling a name out of a hat to pick the winner of a unique prize! Valerie Joerger won this miniature stained-glass City of Portland Flag piece created by BTS&rsquo; very own Emily Tabachnick as well as a $25 VISA gift card provided by an anonymous donor. Join us at future BTS Socials for another chance to win prizes created by your very own co-workers and to socialize.</p>

<p>The BTS Safety Committee has put together a new site with links to resources to help you be more prepared in case you are ever confronted with an Active Shooter situation.&nbsp; The time to think about what you would do in such a situation is before it occurs.&nbsp; Many people freeze in this type of a situation.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because they don&rsquo;t know what to do.&nbsp; Like most people, they haven&rsquo;t thought about it. There are two videos. One produced by the FBI, the other through Homeland Security and Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).&nbsp; Each video goes through the options of Run, Hide, Fight.&nbsp; If you were to run, where would you run? What path would you choose to get there to avoid as much of the danger as possible?&nbsp; If you could not run because you are unable, or you don&rsquo;t have a path to escape, where would you hide?&nbsp; If you hide, what can you do to avoid being seen?&nbsp; What can you do to make it more difficult for the shooter to get to you? &nbsp;&nbsp;And if you have no options left, and you had to fight, what would you fight with?&nbsp; Do you have items nearby that could be used as a weapon?&nbsp; Should you enlist others around you to fight with you to maximize your odds of surviving?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two videos introduce you to these three options and provide you ideas for what your plan might look like.&nbsp; Think about it now.&nbsp; Then, if confronted with this type of situation, you choose your path and execute.&nbsp; This will help you to avoid becoming an easy target.&nbsp; These concepts are for home, in public places, or at work.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a link to additional resources from the FBI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a link to Portland Police Resources including a 38-minute podcast by Officer Leo Harris on Community Active Shooter Preparedness.&nbsp; We highly recommend you take the time to listen to this very informative podcast.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a link to Rose City Self-Defense.</p>
<p>Rose City Self-Defense&nbsp;<strong>empowers girls, women, and the LGBTQ+ community</strong>, with a focus on engaging communities of color, people with disabilities, folks with unstable housing, as well as safety for sex workers.</p>

<p>On December 22nd we lost utility power to our Lookout Point radio site and the site did not switch to generator power as designed. Instead, it went to battery backup which only last for a few hours. They spent the day driving to the site. They had to cut through a couple of fallen trees with chainsaws, drive through snow, and eventually walk the last 1/4 mile to get to the site to switch the site over to the generator before the batteries ran out of power. The loss of this site would have compromised radio coverage in east Multnomah County first responders. Their dedication kept our Radio system operating, and no public safety professional lost coverage.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Has the pandemic and remote working made communicating easier or harder for you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic has thrown me in to a very unique and awkward position where I found myself navigating hearing loss in a way I&rsquo;ve never experienced before. Suddenly everyone&rsquo;s face was covered, and I no longer had lip-reading to rely on. My &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; had disappeared overnight. Without knowledge of ASL, I was faced with the challenge of learning how to communicate with people around me all over again. Even a quick run to the grocery store became a daunting task. It was incredibly difficult, and it continues to be at times. I disliked venturing out into public and I became well acquainted with my new friend, Social Anxiety. Eventually I had to build up my confidence and learn how to advocate for myself more than I was used to when out there interacting with the world. When I started with BTS in November 2021, I was lucky enough to join a team of compassionate colleagues (HEY TPCS!!) that were very patient with me. Never have I experienced a workplace environment where my teammates were so understanding and willing to go the extra mile to help me get settled into my new position. It truly made a difference in my onboarding and I&rsquo;m so incredibly grateful for them.</p>
<p><strong>Victoria:</strong></p>
<p>Pandemic style meetings have been a godsend for me! Assuming people are willing to use their cameras and close captioning, I am in heaven being able to hear most of what is said in a meeting. Pre-pandemic, being the remote person in an in-person meeting was 100% miserable. I might as well not call in because people didn&rsquo;t sit close to the mic. Most of the time the extended mics weren&rsquo;t even present. There was never video or close captioning. If I was attending in person, it was maybe 50% miserable, depending on the group of people. Folks would sit wherever they&rsquo;d like (countertops, floor) and speak with no way for lip-readers to see. People even covered their mouths with their hands. At my last place of employment, I was the outspoken one for all the hearing-impaired. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I shared after an all-staff meeting that I was unable to hear and why. (I shared in the beginning of all-staff meetings too). Usually that info was well received with promises for improvement. It took years before I ever witnessed any of the improvements and I had to keep speaking up.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/800859

<p><strong>Please know that any action you take to be a good ally goes a long way.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question: What is your impairment like and how did you get it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong></p>
<p>My hearing loss stems from birth. My mother contracted Rubella/German Measles during her pregnancy with me. This damaged the cochlea in my ears and the tiny little hairs inside that are responsible for picking up and recognizing different kinds of sounds. My hearing loss is considered a profound hearing loss. Without my hearing aid, sounds need to be so loud, it could very well damage a hearing person&rsquo;s ears. I have an easier time recognizing lower frequencies than I do higher frequencies. If your face is covered or obstructed, I still can hear you. I just can&rsquo;t make sense of the words you&rsquo;re saying. It sounds like a foreign language or gibberish to me. That&rsquo;s where the lip-reading skill comes in and fills in the blanks for me. My entire family is hearing so they raised me as a hearing person. In the 80&rsquo;s there was this expectation that a deaf or hearing-impaired person would never amount to all the things that a normal, hearing person could. Because of that, my parents thought it was best that I went to school full time at the age of 3 to learn how to read lips and talk like a hearing person. In 2004 I attempted to get a cochlear implant in my left ear, and it failed horribly. I lost all the natural hearing I had in that ear and now I am down to just the one remaining and somewhat functioning ear.</p>

<p>I was born with my impairment but wasn't diagnosed until my early thirties. I can&rsquo;t really explain why my &ldquo;kid&rdquo; self didn&rsquo;t draw more attention to the issue. My closest friends all knew. No adults in my life knew and somehow my school system never tested me. I do recall one day in early grade school when I was tested for speech impairments, but I managed to talk the adult tester out of flagging me for special classes. I got by sitting in front of the class and fully embracing my nerd identity.</p>
<p>My mother has also been impaired all or most of her life. When I was a baby, my grandmother and mother did their own tests on me. The banged pots and pans to see if I would respond to the noise. I passed their test with flying colors, and they were satisfied that my hearing was &ldquo;normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One reason I might have stopped telling most people as a child is because I got so tired of people telling me that I just liked to make them repeat themselves. People dismissed my explanations that I could not hear them and would state that I just like to say, &ldquo;what?&rdquo; just to annoy them.<br /> <br /> The reason I got tested in my early thirties was because my employer wanted a baseline test for me. My employer tested every year, and the baseline would serve to let them know if my hearing changed while employed there. As a telecommunications technician, I sometimes worked with equipment that could potentially damage my ears.</p>
<p>After stepping out of the audiology booth the day of my first test, the audiologist told me I needed to see an ENT. She also pointed out that I can&rsquo;t &ldquo;hear men well.&rdquo; Weeks later, the audiologist confirmed that I had likely been born with my impairment and that it likely has never changed. She told me three other things:</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">1.&nbsp; That I have what&rsquo;s known as Cookie Bite. My last test looked like this:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=800847"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""252.242152466"" /><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=800848"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""228.32103321"" /></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">2.&nbsp; That people with far better hearing than me get hearing aids.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">3.&nbsp; Since I&rsquo;ve been getting along without hearing aids, I didn&rsquo;t absolutely need to get them yet.</span></p>
<p>She advised that a day would come that it bothered me that others were bothered that I couldn&rsquo;t hear them. She said that&rsquo;s when I should invest in the aides.</p>
<p>That day quickly came. After I had proof of what I&rsquo;d known all along, I felt more justified saying, &ldquo;what?&rdquo; again. The two people closest to me at the time, my spouse and a coworker, started to get very annoyed. I got the aides to help put them out of their misery.</p>
<p>What is a &ldquo;Cookie Bite&rdquo; you ask? As you can see from my last test, I have perfect hearing at the very lowest frequency they test for and pretty much perfect hearing at the highest frequency. The high frequencies are what people tend to lose as they age or due to loud sounds. I likely can still hear those rings tones kids used to use so adults wouldn&rsquo;t hear their cell phones ring in class.</p>
<p>Here are the different ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal hearing</strong>: -10 to 20 dB<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Mild hearing loss</strong>: 20 to 40 dB higher than normal<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Moderate hearing loss</strong>: 40 to 70 dB higher than normal<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Severe hearing loss</strong>: 70 to 90 dB higher than normal<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Profound loss</strong>: 90 dB or more<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Since my &ldquo;loss&rdquo; dips down to almost 70 dB, I usually describe my impairment as &ldquo;moderately-severe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My tests have not changed over the years. Someday, I imagine my high frequencies will go. I do everything I can to protect my ears to help avoid that.</p>
<p>I miss syllables mostly. It means, even with hearing aids, my brain must work extra hard to fill in the gaps. This is why I will suddenly understand an entire sentence mid-way when someone complies with my request to repeat themself.</p>
<p>Another tidbit: When I was diagnosed with the Cookie Bite, most audiologists had never heard of such a thing. It&rsquo;s only in the last several years that hearing aid technology has become sophisticated enough to correct for a Cookie Bite. Thus, audiologists now know.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/800844

<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=800787"" alt=""Dilbert hearing impaired"" width=""500"" height=""166.446499339"" /></p>
<p><strong>Here are tips Michael and Victoria put together on how to be an ally for hearing impaired folks:</strong></p>
<p><em>Please keep in mind that not every deaf/hearing impaired person has the same preferences.</em></p>
<p><strong>In General:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make (and keep) eye contact.<strong> </strong><strong></strong></li>
<li>If we politely ask you to repeat yourself, please do not treat us like we didn&rsquo;t understand you and treat us like we&rsquo;re stupid. We are capable of understanding if we can hear what you are saying.<strong> </strong><strong></strong></li>
<li>If we don&rsquo;t respond to our name, or something you&rsquo;ve said to us, please wave or do something to gently get our attention. For some hearing impaired, we may encourage you to tap us on the shoulder but please confirm that before trying that out.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not ok to raise your voice, shout, or talk to us in a slow and condescending manner. Yes, this is something we go through way too often.<strong></strong></li>
<li>Do not talk over others because we can only read one set of lips at a time. Our hearing aids likely can&rsquo;t sort out the competing conversations despite how much better the tech has become.</li>
<li>If there&rsquo;s a word or phrase that we&rsquo;re having a difficult time understanding, choosing a different word or re-phrasing always helps. Jotting the word or phrase down on a notepad is also helpful.<strong></strong></li>
<li>Use written communication to ensure complex topics are fully understood by everyone on the team.&nbsp; Consider using chat windows and emails to follow up after important verbal communication.</li>
<li>Phone conversations for most hearing impaired are especially challenging. Some of us have assistive technology for this but there are still limitations and challenges.&nbsp; People on the other line are generally not that accommodating or understanding. Oftentimes they say they&rsquo;re &ldquo;Not interested&rdquo; and hang up on us. Please consider using video chat with hearing impaired. If in an office environment where the phone is ringing, offer to be the one to answer the phone.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Reading Lips&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just about reading lips. It uses the whole lower half of the face. For example, depending on the sounds being vocalized, a chin moves up and down or cheek muscles change the face shape in different ways.&nbsp; Therefore, transparent masks at their best, when they don&rsquo;t fog up, are like trying to read a book with a single tealight candle. It&rsquo;s better than no light at all, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s an effortless experience.</li>
<li>When practicing good mask wearing techniques, don&rsquo;t pull your mask down when you realize a hearing-impaired person can&rsquo;t hear you. Find a mask-friendly way to communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Video Calls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on your video so hearing-impaired people can see both your lips and your body language.</li>
<li>If you are hosting a Zoom or WebEx meeting, make sure the closed captioning feature is enabled before starting the meeting so attendees can utilize this feature.</li>
<li>Turn on the closed captioning feature for yourself so you can see if it captures your words accurately.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re hosting a training on Zoom, let attendees in early so they can set up their audio. Hearing impaired folks may need more time to set up their audio and will miss valuable early meeting time if you let them in just as the meeting starts. Try to let them in at least ten minutes ahead of time.</li>
<li>Encourage others to turn on their cameras and use closed captioning.</li>
<li>Encourage the use of the chat window to follow up after important/complex verbal communications.</li>
<li>Encourage the use of the chat window for icebreakers and other social interactions where multiple people may be inclined to all chat at once.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In-Person Meetings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If attending an in-person meeting, make sure your mouth is visible to all attendees and speak to be heard. Don&rsquo;t turn your back and only talk to the person beside you. If there are microphones, use them.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re a speaker at an in-person event or meeting, when you get to the podium don&rsquo;t dismiss the mic and then ask (without using the mic) if everyone can hear you. That singles people out in your audience. Many people with far better hearing than ours will not be able to hear you and will be too shy to tell you when put on the spot like that.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Know that any action you take to be a good ally goes a really long way. We realize we must advocate for ourselves but it&rsquo;s exhausting.<strong></strong></li>

BTS Blog,800721,Aaron Johnson - Game Changer,1,,2022-09-15 22:46:34 UTC,2022-09-15 20:31:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Erin Poole and James Apple</em></p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=800719"" alt=""Aaron Johnson receiving the Game Changer award"" width=""500"" height=""720.719234576"" /></p>
<p>Introducing a new award for BTS staff members who look to implement innovate ideas that enhance our services offerings while reducing costs to customers, and we&rsquo;re calling it <strong>the Game Changer award</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The award name derives from our first recipient, Aaron Johnson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, Aaron, attended the ISC West Security Conference in Las Vegas. While touring product offerings on the show floor, he identified a new cable made by Paige Datacom called &ldquo;GameChanger&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The marketing materials claimed it could easily exceed current Ethernet standards defined in IEEE 802.3*. Recognizing the advantage of this cable in reducing the complexity needed for cable runs exceeding 300 feet, Aaron recommended on his return they give it a try. The vendor was contacted and we inquired about testing this cable out. Paige Datacom was very excited and quickly got the product to us, adding in connectors and crimpers for free to help offset the cost of shipping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team installed a camera using this new cable at a PBOT facility, about 700 feet of it. Typically, this install would have required fiber and power to accommodate the long distance, media converters to switch back to copper at both ends, all adding potential multiple points of failure in the future. The new GameChanger cable worked as advertised and the Video Team has been using it since this first test run, with zero issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aaron&rsquo;s recommendation has seriously been a &ldquo;Game Changer&rdquo; for the BTS Video Team and how we engineer our installations. In 2019, Paige Datacom received their patent for this new product and instantly became a coveted item among low voltage security contractors. The Video Team added the GameChanger cable to its toolkit and has greatly reduced video installation complexity and associated costs for our Bureau customers. Return on investment, the cost of the conference, was achieved in the first installation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice work Aaron, thank you for your innovative thinking!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=800704"" alt=""Melody receiving her SuerStar award"" width=""450"" height=""600"" /></p>
<p>The BTS Recognition Committee was formed in 2016 and quickly launched the SuperStar award to show appreciation for BTS individuals who demonstrated exceptional customer service, peer support, or work product. Several recipients have received this award over the years, but we took a snooze during the pandemic as it made for personal handoff a bit difficult. Now we are back with the latest <strong>SuperStar</strong>!</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know her yet, please consider yourself introduced to Melody Fisher, SuperStar! Melody works in the Project Management Office as a project manager, and she has had the privilege of being assigned several fun projects. Melody was nominated by not just one, but several people (including me) for her extraordinary work on the MFA project.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you don&rsquo;t know what the MFA project is yet, please read your emails, because you might have some follow-up actions that need done.</em></p>
<p>So why the MFA project? This was an urgent security project with a tight timeline, a number of stakeholders that had to agree on approach and priority, plus a very uphill climb to find a successful path for customer communication. I asked people if it was too dramatic to describe the project as &ldquo;herding cats in a fire drill&rdquo; and then heard it was like &ldquo;sailing a ship made of popsicle sticks on a gasoline ocean with a cargo of fireworks to be delivered to an insane asylum&rdquo;. That might give you a sense of what Melody is helping us navigate &ndash; mostly lots of challenges plus an uphill climb for follow-thru. Here's what some people had to say about Melody's work on MFA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melody has kept us on task despite the strong feelings, frustrations, personalities, resource constraints, and urgency. She talks straight and focuses us on what needs to happen next. This is no easy feat, but we are moving forward steadily under her fantastic project management guidance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how Melody stays so calm with all the challenges of this project. She seems unfazed and is keeping it moving. It&rsquo;s so nice to have her at the helm of such an important project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melody is one of the best PMs I have worked with. She's engaging, enthusiastic and irreplaceable. She is always professional and considering the complexity of MFA, the breadth and depth of its effect, and the politics involved, this is no small effort. She&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;a Superstar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you, Melody!</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">The BTS Employee Recognition committee is pleased to introduce the <strong>Everyday Hero</strong> award. What is an everyday hero? Well here in BTS, an everyday hero is someone who makes excellence a part of the way they operate every single day. Not only do they put in the work with a great attitude; an everyday hero also embodies trust, teamwork, and the customer experience.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">I&rsquo;m proud to announce that Juliann Schmidt is our first Everyday Hero! As a member of the Cellular Services group in Systems Engineering, Juli does bring a great attitude, along with a passion for the customer experience. Her work consistently brings value to the Support Center. In fact, Juli was integral to keeping things running smoothly during the pandemic by reporting onsite every day. When she first came to Cellular Services from Printing &amp; Distribution, Juli was not an iOS expert, but she learned so quickly that she teaches the rest of us new things regularly. If you received a City iPhone or iPad during the last few years, Juli probably set it up for you.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">But don&rsquo;t just take my word for it. She was nominated by Charlie Ferranti who wrote:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">&ldquo;Well Juli Schmidt is my everyday hero. Day in and day out she brings answers with a smile and a laugh. Curve balls don&rsquo;t upset her, and she always is quick to assist whatever the request may be, regardless of the team working on the issue &ndash; if she can provide assistance she is happy to help. Where there&rsquo;s heat, Juli brings cool and calm.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">And a few customer comments: </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14.52px;"">""I wanted to let you know what a great employee you have in Juliann Schmidt. Such a joy to work with and always ready to help as quickly and in depth as needed. Just wanted to give a shout out for her working so quickly under pressure and being a stellar employee. She's awesome! (including during the rollout of the new EMM system)""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">&ldquo;Juli is always amazing and so helpful. She seems genuinely interested in making things better. I hope you give her a big raise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">&ldquo;Juli is absolutely the best! She obviously hates to be idle and is generally willing to do anything, even if she has to learn it while helping you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>No big surprise, right? P&amp;D never stopped doing business, in fact&hellip; we're just getting started!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might guess that there have been many recent changes at P&amp;D resulting from the shift to more remote work as well as changes already observed in the printing and mailroom/distribution industry overall.&nbsp; One recent change is a change in the long-time leadership of P&amp;D after some retirements, resulting in my new role as the Supervisor of the P&amp;D Program.&nbsp; Another big change:&nbsp; did you know that P&amp;D is now part of BTS? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s right, as of May of this year P&amp;D was permanently assigned as a program inside the BTS Support Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responding to all these changes, the Bureau of Technology Services (BTS) contracted with an outside consultant, Synergy Resources Group (SRG) to perform an independent assessment of P&amp;D&rsquo;s operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assessment has now been completed and took a snapshot of P&amp;D operations, from the perspective of both P&amp;D Employees and Customers.&nbsp; SRG worked to detail the impact of the pandemic and other changes on the P&amp;D service and product. The assessment gives us some tools which will help P&amp;D grow and evolve into a more modern and forward looking service into the future.</p>

<p class=""content-left""><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">Greetings BTS Friends,</span></p>
<p>Some of you may have heard that I&rsquo;ve recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. I&rsquo;m very fortunate to have caught it through routine screenings and have begun aggressive treatment. My prognosis is very positive, and I&rsquo;ve begun my journey.</p>
<p>My cancer support team at the <a href=""https://www.providence.org/locations/or/portland-medical-center/cancer-institute-franz-breast-care-clinic"">Providence Cancer Institute Franz Breast Care Clinic</a> has been instrumental in providing information, counseling and compassion through every step of my treatment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, too many of us have experienced the impact of breast cancer. I imagine many of you could name a friend, family member, or someone in the news who&rsquo;s experienced it firsthand.</p>
<p>Through my process of adjusting to the realities of chemotherapy, I&rsquo;ve lost my hair (most of it) in the past month. That gave me an idea, why not put a challenge out to each of you?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m proposing:</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get an early jump on the<strong> BTS Tech in Pink drive</strong> for the <a href=""https://www.komen.org/"">Susan B. Komen foundation</a>.</p>
<p>My pledge this year, I&rsquo;ll donate $20 per person for those of you willing to shave your heads (or close to it)! Email me a picture as proof. I&rsquo;ll give each of you through the month of August to get cutting.</p>
<p>My partner, family, and some BTS friends have already gotten into the spirit!</p>
<p>Susanne&rsquo;s solidarity, her very short, cute haircut:</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=800258"" alt=""photo of Erin Poole and her partner Suzanne with short hair"" width=""250"" height=""205.117449664"" /></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my beloved Aunt looking beautiful with close cropped hair:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=800259"" alt=""a photo of Erin's aunt with short hair"" width=""250"" height=""333.333333333"" /></p>
<p><strong>First</strong> BTS employee to take me up on my idea was Matt Rounds:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=800260"" alt=""Photo of Matt Rounds showing off his no-hair look"" width=""250"" height=""270.955165692"" /></p>
<p><strong>Next</strong> to jump in, James Apple:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=800261"" alt=""photo of James Apple with his hair shaved off"" width=""250"" height=""378.147482014"" /></p>
<p>Elyse chose to donate to <a href=""https://greatergood.com/clicktogive/ggc/home"">GreaterGood Charities</a> (vs cut any hairs off), she also contributed $20 which I&rsquo;ll pass along to the Komen kitty.</p>
<p><em>Who else would like to participate?</em> Email me a picture as proof, and I&rsquo;ll continue to add it up. So far, I&rsquo;m up to $120, I couldn&rsquo;t think of a better charity to give to.</p>
<p>Not sure you want to have hair that short? Here&rsquo;s another option, donate 10 inches of your hair to <a href=""https://locksoflove.org/"">Locks of Love</a>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their mission is to return a sense of self, confidence and normalcy to children suffering from hair loss by utilizing donated ponytails to provide the highest quality hair prosthetics to financially disadvantaged children free of charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll donate $20 for each of you who provide picture evidence you&rsquo;ve donated your ponytail!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good timing, it&rsquo;s HOT and I&rsquo;m thankful I don&rsquo;t have long hair right now. This challenge will go through the month of August, so get thinking &ndash; who wants to see what they look like with a shaved head, or a really, really short haircut, <strong>OR</strong> - which of you is ready to cut off 10 inches of their hair?!</p>
<p>Cancer can happen to any of us, or to someone we love. The breast cancer numbers below are a stark reminder that we need to get those annual screenings, reach out to our health care providers, and make our health a priority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 2022, it&rsquo;s estimated among women in the U.S. there will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>287,850 new cases of invasive breast cancer</li>
<li>Men in the U.S. will see 2,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks in advance, I look forward to &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; who participates.</p>

<p>The BTS Equity Committee is happy to share an interview we did with OMF&rsquo;s new Racial Equity Program Manager, Juan Carlos Oca&ntilde;a-Ch&iacute;u. Read below to find out a little about him and his plans for making OMF a more Equitable workplace.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Thorns and Timbers</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Equity Questions</h2>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you see as the role of individual bureau Equity Committees in your bigger, immediate goals/initiatives?</strong></p>
<p>Advancing racial equity is part of everybody&rsquo;s work at the City of Portland. City Council made the policy decision to lead with racial equity and anti-racism. That means that everything we do as public servants needs to have a positive, racial equity and anti-racist impact, and improve the lives of Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) communities and other historically and continually marginalized communities. The equity committees, like the one at the Bureau of Technology Services (BTS), have a key role in advancing racial equity. Equity committees know their bureaus best and can help find the best ways to implement racial equity and anti-racist work internally. They can also generate new ideas that are more specific and appropriate for their bureaus, and create concrete opportunities for bureau staff to get involved in this crucial work. I&rsquo;m really excited to see that BTS has an active equity committee that is supported by leadership. I look forward to learning more about the committee&rsquo;s work and being a resource for you in having greater racial equity and anti-racism impacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is one initiative/goal you hope to have running this year?</strong></p>
<p>I am working on a few initiatives that I want to launch during my first year as the OMF racial equity program manager, and there is one that is especially important to me. I want to work with folks in BTS and in other bureaus and teams in the Office of Management and Finance (OMF) to find great examples of how our work has a positive racial equity impact on BIPOC communities. In my short time on this job, I have heard many folks at OMF talk about how they provide services to other City employees. And while this is true, I strongly believe we need to make the connection about how these services have an impact in the community at large. I believe that everything BTS staff, and all OMF staff, do contributes to making life better for Portlanders. So I want to work with the racial equity committee and everybody else in the bureau, to find those stories, polish them, and start telling them to ourselves and to the public. I am sure we will find some amazing stories that we can proudly share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you think Technology impacts equity?</strong></p>
<p>Information technology (IT) is foundational for almost everything we do on this day and age. Communications, work, learning, entertainment, wellbeing, you name it. It all relies on IT to run smoothly. And like any technology, IT has the potential to be used to advance greater racial equity or to work against it. It is our responsibility as public servants to ensure that we use IT for the benefit of all Portlanders, and not just of the groups that have traditionally enjoyed those benefits. Working toward digital inclusion is the best way how we at BTS and all of OMF can ensure that the benefits of current IT are available to all communities in our city, especially to those that have been traditionally excluded from them. The COVID-19 pandemic has also made it easier to provide IT tools and capacity to expand digital inclusion in the form of new ways for Portlanders to interact with their municipal government to request and receive services, to learn about City work and initiatives, and to participate in the governance of our city. If we continue to apply an intersectional racial equity lens to how we provide IT tools and services, we can realize the promise of technology as a powerful tool to expand opportunity and improve outcomes for BIPOC and other historically and continually marginalized communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What advice would you give to somebody who is new to approaching their work through a racial equity lens? Where might they start?</strong></p>
<p>We each bring our particular experiences and backgrounds to our work. We are also all situated differently by virtue of our job titles and classifications, racial and gender identities, ability status, sexual orientation, income, class, and many other characteristics. We have privilege because of some of our characteristics, and we experience oppression because of others. I recommend that folks new to racial equity work reflect on their identities, especially racial identity, in terms of privilege and oppression: where do they benefit and where they are oppressed. Folks who have traditionally had privilege should do their own research and reflect on the systems that give them privilege and how they benefit from them. Ideally, they should also reflect on what they can do to contribute to changing those systems. I strongly recommend against folks with privilege asking their relatives, colleagues and/or friends who experience oppression to teach them about those systems of oppression and their struggle. For example, I experience oppression as an immigrant of color in this country, but I also experience privilege as a cisgender, straight man with a decent income. It is my personal responsibility to educate myself about the struggles of folks that experience oppression in the areas where I have privilege, and to find ways for me to be a better ally to them. There are a number of resources where we can all learn about oppression and how to be better allies to support the struggle for liberation that our relatives, colleagues and communities are going through. A great place to start learning about racial equity is this <a href=""/oehr/66269"">Equity Resources webpage </a>by the City&rsquo;s own Office of Equity and Human Rights. The Office also offers excellent trainings to City staff on racial equity, like the Racial Equity 101 class.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/799743
BTS Blog,799685,Printing and Distribution (P&D) Assessment Report Summary,1,,2022-05-18 23:16:45 UTC,2022-05-18 23:06:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Matthew Spitulski and Bryan Pirrello</em></p>
<p><em> February 2022</em></p>
<p>The Bureau of Technology Services (BTS) contracted with Synergy Resources Group (SRG) to perform an independent assessment of P&amp;D&rsquo;s operations, trends before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as projections for customer utilization in the next 2-5 years.</p>
<p><strong>Critical elements of the assessment included:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Financial analysis: customer utilization, services utilization and in bureau copier utilization.</p>
<p>&bull; Interviews: P&amp;D staff, Bureau operations managers, Bureau staff with direct contact with P&amp;D.</p>
<p>&bull; Customer survey</p>
<p>&bull; Market review: Comparing printing rates and services in both the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>&bull; OMF&rsquo;s 2021 Rate study: Utilized applicable information to support the assessment. Based on the analysis, SRG presented key findings and recommendations along with a scenario to support BTS and the P&amp;D division in determining the best path forward.</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Share Summary and Report with P&amp;D Staff</p>
<p>&bull; Provide P&amp;D Staff the opportunity to meet individually with SRG and/or Matthew and Bryan to ask questions</p>
<p>&bull; Draft Frequently Asked Questions and Communications for staff, stakeholders, and customers</p>
<p>&bull; Implementation planning</p>
<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Overall, there has been a significant disruption in printing needs due to the pandemic, with 33% drop in revenue between the fiscal year (FY) 18-19 and FY20-21.</p>
<p>&bull; According to customer interviews and surveys, most do not expect print volumes to return to pre pandemic volumes. More likely customers expect an increase from current levels.</p>
<p>&bull; Customers value P&amp;D staff procuring printing services for jobs that are outside the division&rsquo;s scope, specialty and capacity to execute in the print shop.</p>
<p>&bull; Distribution and Mail Services may be the most stable in terms of bureaus keeping utilization levels consistent from current and pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>&bull; In-Bureau Copier services are likely to continue their downward trend, due to behavioral changes as a result of the pandemic and future plans for City staff continuing to work remotely.</p>
<p>&bull; Only a small percentage of P&amp;D public sector peers nationwide have centralized printing services. Most departmental/agency budgets cover the cost of printing and delivery.</p>
<p>&bull; P&amp;D staff possess many other skills which include the ability to provide quality customer service, prioritize tasks, manage workflow, work as a team, and perform on a deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Key Recommendations: Note that BTS Leadership has committed that no current P&amp;D staff will lose their job as a result of implementing any recommendations.</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Continue to right size the division as print and mail volumes become more apparent, in the years to come, through attrition, in bureau transfers or new hires.</p>
<p>&bull; Consider an external management service to manage the in-bureau copiers with functionality that includes the ability to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; a print job or use a copier anywhere in the City. Bureaus pay the vendor on a per-sheet basis.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop formal agreements with private sector commercial printing businesses to provide the print services outside of P&amp;D&rsquo;s scope, specialty, and equipment. Bureau operations managers are expecting the FY2021-22 rate increase to be adjusted down after last year&rsquo;s increase. With a $1.5&nbsp;million decline in revenue from 2019-20 to the forecasted 2021-22 revenue, it will be important to evaluate a rate adjustment downward.</p>

BTS Blog,799639,BTS Blog – Path to Leadership,1,,2022-05-16 16:42:32 UTC,2022-05-16 16:20:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Melissa Mills and Elonda Bristol</em></p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=799640"" alt=""Screenshot of Path to Leadership Cohort"" width=""550"" height=""325.469653179"" /></p>
<p>Path to Leadership is a values-based leadership program that prepares emerging City leaders for supervisory roles. Elonda Bristol and Melissa Mills graduated in April, having completed the 9-month program. HR has announced they are beginning recruitment for the next cohort. You can go to <a href=""https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/portlandor/jobs/3068236/path-to-leadership-program?pagetype=promotionalJobs"">NeoGov</a> to apply for the 2022/2023 program through May 17<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Path to Leadership provides an opportunity for developing your leadership skills through the lens of the City&rsquo;s core values &ndash; Anti-Racism, Collaboration, Communication, Equity, Fiscal Responsibility, and Transparency. This isn&rsquo;t a management program where you are going to learn to how to make fancy excel sheets to keep up with the minutia of daily activities (although if you are interested in improving your excel skills check out <a href=""https://app.quickhelp.com/PortlandOregon"">QuickHelp</a>!). Participants attend trainings, are put through thought exercises, and learn from each other through discussion. Numerous experts gave trainings on equity, leadership style, personal successes and failures within their careers, how to take negative feedback, and creating a work/life balance.&nbsp; You are given possible work scenarios and talk through them with peers while applying the City&rsquo;s values. Listening to how peers would handle situations opens your mind to different approaches.</p>
<p>The program ends with presenting an Impact Project. Melissa&rsquo;s group presented on how best to create an inclusive work environment for field employees and Elonda&rsquo;s group looked at how to recruit and retain employees of color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Melissa&rsquo;s Highlight</span></p>
<p>My favorite part of the program was the connections I made with employees from other bureaus. I think we all know silos exist and are hard to overcome. It can be hard to know what other BTS teams are up too, let alone other groups within the City.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Elonda&rsquo;s Highlight</span></p>
<p>I really enjoyed the opportunity to be a part of this learning experience.&nbsp; The highlight, however, and as Melissa mentioned, was developing connections with employees from other bureaus and being able to hear their successes and struggles as they build their careers with the City.&nbsp; There are rarely opportunities for us to branch from our own bureaus to develop working relationships if we aren&rsquo;t on a project or assignment together.&nbsp; Meeting other employees and building relationships was key to being successful in the program and I believe those relationships and that foundation will also be paramount to a successful career with the City.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have an interest in leadership, it&rsquo;s 100% worth your time to go through this program!</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/799639
BTS Blog,799067,Extreme Makeover - SAP Edition!,1,,2022-04-05 18:27:43 UTC,2022-03-22 20:49:00 UTC,A,A blog article about the SAP HANA Migration Project,"<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=799068"" alt=""Generic Blue Technology Image"" width=""600"" height=""214.347826087"" /></p>
<p><em>By HANA Project Team</em></p>
<p>The Bureau of Technology Services migrated the City&rsquo;s SAP applications from Oracle database to SAP HANA database on December 5<sup>th</sup>, 2021. The initiative to migrate the database were based on several key business drivers, including some of the following.<em></em></p>
<ul>
<li>The current implementation of SAP was launched in 2008 and requires a strategic infrastructure refresh to set the platform up for the next 5-7 years.</li>
<li>Platform refresh supports the City&rsquo;s SAP Strategic Roadmap which the TESC - Technology Executive Steering Committee approved in 2019.</li>
<li>Allows the City to best utilize the existing investment in SAP to support future opportunities to expand beyond a tradition ERP system.</li>
<li>Oracle databases are out of support.</li>
<li>Moves SAP off the more expensive AIX server platform to Unix/Red Hat reducing costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The migration took an entire weekend, from 5 PM on Friday, December 3<sup>rd</sup> to 11 AM on Sunday, December 5<sup>th</sup> to complete the production cutover. It was a two-phase project, started with a design phase which was completed with the purchasing of the hardware in 2020. The implementation phase was scheduled to follow right after the delivery of the hardware, but was delayed until April 2021, due to the interruption of COVID19. It was a multi-team project led by Enterprise Business Solution (EBS) division, and spanning most, if not all areas in BTS. The migration touched several infrastructure, software, users, and processes across the city, from check printing, payroll processing, and vendor invoicing.</p>
<p>In addition to the key business drivers, the new HANA servers provide faster processing and improve reporting performance. Users of the new HANA database applications have already seen great improvement. Below are some of the statistics gathered before and after the migration.</p>

<p>The completion of the HANA migration puts the city in a solid position to implement the future SAP roadmap. The HANA platform provides the base digital core that seamlessly integrates with other SAP products and partners. With HANA, we can implement new Human Capital Management (HCM) applications, such as Employee Central which provides the breadth of HCM functionality, and S/4HANA to enhance and transform critical enterprise functions, ranging from financial accounting to procurement. This initiative aligns with the strategic roadmap for the City of Portland to best utilize our existing investment in SAP by positioning us to move forward with technology that enable a whole host of benefits.</p>
<p>The success of the project is a testament to the City&rsquo;s Bureau of Technologies dedicated and talented workforce, and we feel confident in our ability to deploy future complex projects. Kudo&rsquo;s to the BTS HANA project team members for their perseverance and dedication! Below are few pictures of team members who were able to attend the project celebration on January 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p><em>By BTS Equity Committee</em></p>
<p>The BTS Equity Committee is a small part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s Equitable Workplace Vision. We provide Quarterly Bureau Equity Sessions, training opportunities, and review of internal policies, but the City has many resources and programs. An exciting update is that OMF now has its own Racial Equity Program Manager, Juan Carlos Oca&ntilde;a-Ch&iacute;u! We look forward to learning from and collaborating with Juan Carlos. I hope you had a chance to read Tom Rinehart&rsquo;s email on January 5<sup>th</sup> welcoming Juan Carlos and outlining his priorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, we would like to highlight the <a href=""/50880"">Diverse and Empowered Employees of Portland</a>. DEEP is a City of Portland employee-driven program that supports a creative and inclusive work environment. They provide mentoring, education, leadership, and networking opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DEEP does an excellent job of producing educational material. Perhaps some of you have this link on your email or have seen it &ldquo;<a href=""/article/705244"">Why pronouns are listed in my signature?</a>.&rdquo; For some transgender and gender non-binary people, pronouns are an important part of expressing identity. Listing pronouns helps normalize gender discussion. We are all on the same team and being respectful and creating a safe work environment is something we all deserve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the coolest projects DEEP oversees is the Affinity Groups. <a href=""/50888"">Affinity Groups</a> are voluntary employee-led groups that share a particular protected class such as race, disability, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. Please look through the eleven, soon to be twelve groups and see if there are any of interest to you! To be a part of an affinity group, sign up to be on an email list at <a href=""/deep/signup"">www.portlandoregon.gov/deep/signup</a>. Paid time is available for attending meetings, as well as other Affinity Group leadership and volunteer activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DEEP and the Affinity Groups have partnered with City Council members and led many positive changes at the City over the years. A few of the projects that you may recognize are the Lactation Rooms led by PDX City Parents; Trans Healthcare and All User Restrooms, led by LGBTQIA+ &amp; Friends; partnerships with LGBTQIA+ &amp; Friends and Women&rsquo;s Empowerment on expanded Bereavement Leave policies; City African American Network (CAAN) writing, distributing, and continuing to lead efforts regarding the City&rsquo;s Black Workforce and disparities for these employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2022, DEEP is in the process of launching its Leadership Development Program for Affinity Groups with a focus on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color employees. Keep an eye out for communications on this exciting opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having an inclusive and kind work environment benefits us all. Fair treatment no matter protected class, clears the way for us to show up and do our jobs.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/798389

<p>The BTS Recognition Committee has completed giving out years of service certificated to staff.&nbsp; As you may recall from our last all staff meeting in 2019 (this was the one at the PSU hotel) we gave out certificates to those completing a year of service at the 5-year breaks, i.e. 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 25 years, and 30 years.&nbsp; Because of the pandemic we did not get them out last year but over the past few months we had them produced and sent them out.&nbsp; As before, they are all signed by Jeff, and &nbsp;the 30 year and up certificates also get signed by the Mayor and are framed.</p>

<p>Given that we are all mostly not downtown as of late we decided to have P&amp;D mail them all.&nbsp; We had a delay on these due to protestors <a href=""https://www.flashalertnewswire.net/images/news/2021-11/3056/150308/Print_Shop_Damage_111921d.JPG"">breaking</a> <a href=""https://www.flashalertnewswire.net/images/news/2021-11/3056/150308/Print_Shop_Damage_111921.JPG"">into</a> P&amp;D and using them to start a fire down the street, so special thanks to the team there for going the extra mile and redoing them after their workspace was disrupted.&nbsp; We appreciate you for literally being on the front lines while many of us have been teleworking.</p>

<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html"">American Cancer Society</a>, a women in the US has a 13% chance of developing breast cancer in her lifetime.&nbsp;There are about 3.5 million breast cancer survivors in the US. But there are significant disparities when it comes to race. African American women have a <a href=""https://www.bcpp.org/resource/african-american-women-and-breast-cancer/"">31% breast cancer mortality rate</a> &ndash; the highest of any U.S. racial or ethnic group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recognition of the impact breast cancer has had on our lives, particularly the lives of our Black family and friends, BTS held our 4<sup>th</sup> Tech In Pink Day, challenging employees to wear pink on October 26 and donating on behalf of each person who did.&nbsp; And you delivered!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to 162 BTS employees and 30 customers/partners who wore pink and 22 people who donated, $3,034 was raised for the </strong><a href=""https://www.komen.org/about-komen/our-impact/breast-cancer/health-equities-initiative/?_ga=2.190809199.574655446.1634589185-658113968.1632949891""><strong>Susan G. Komen Foundation's Health Equity Initiative</strong></a><strong>! &nbsp;</strong>That&rsquo;s 18% more than we raised last year!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wearing everything from pink wigs and jewelry to pink hats and masks, members of every BTS team participated to make this day a success &ndash; and a lot of fun!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a small sample from Comunications, the HelpDesk, Production Services, Printing &amp; Distribution, Enterprise Busienss Solutions, Public Safety Technology, and Business Solutions! You can see more pictures of your pink-wearing colleagues on the BTS Common Drive at <a href=""file://btsfile1/Common/Tech%20in%20Pink/2021/Tech%20in%20Pink%202021%20Pix"">\\btsfile1\Common\Tech in Pink\2021\Tech in Pink 2021 Pix</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your generosity in helping to turn BTS pink on October 26!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

BTS Blog,796173,BTS HelpDesk: Pandemic Edition,1,,2021-09-16 22:58:31 UTC,2021-09-16 22:42:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Victor Cabunoc</em></p>
<p>Much like our peers throughout the city, the BTS HelpDesk had to make significant changes to the way we operated after the pandemic hit. Despite the initial learning curve associated with adjusting to remote work, the HelpDesk has found creative solutions to not only replicate the level of work Pre-Covid, but also improve in some key areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img title=""Empty Help Desk 1 Work Area"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=796170"" alt=""Empty area where Help Desk one took calls"" width=""350"" height=""466.666666667"" /></p>
<p><em>Pictured: An empty bullpen area where HD1 (HelpDesk Level 1) once took calls.</em></p>
<p>The biggest change to our operations was the transition from working in-person at the office to working remotely. Historically, the BTS HelpDesk seldom teleworked because we did not have a method to answer support calls without a physical Avaya desk phone &amp; handset. However, thanks to the Telecom team's rapid response, we now have Avaya softphones installed on our computers and can answer HelpDesk calls from home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img title=""Tray of RSA tokens"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=796171"" alt=""Tray of RSA tokens"" width=""400"" height=""360"" /></p>
<p><em>Pictured: A tray of RSA hardware tokens</em></p>
<p>Not only did the <em>way</em> we answer phone calls change, but the types of calls themselves changed drastically as well. Our team had never supported this many teleworking customers in the past. RSA Tokens were flying off the shelves to the point where our vendor had difficulties keeping up with demand.</p>
<p>Providing technical assistance to customers in a new VPN environment while working remotely posed challenges such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average length of a phone call is longer due to the dependence on VPN to do basic troubleshooting tasks (something we didn&rsquo;t give much thought to when most of us were physically connected to the same network)</li>
<li>Troubleshooting VPN connectivity issues in general</li>
<li>Instructing customers how to connect to VPN with their authentication method (Hardware/Software token or Tokenless)</li>
<li>Having consideration for every customers&rsquo; unique home set up</li>
<li>Not having direct physical access to leads or other coworkers (the HelpDesk bullpen) to look over our shoulders at a problem</li>
<li>No existing processes in place for our new environment</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">Despite the loss of a physical collaborative space where we can ask questions or communicate directly with each other, we have found that embracing Microsoft Teams has improved this aspect of collaboration. Being able to have information and questions flow through dedicated channels has increased responsiveness and visibility from the leads and other HD1 members. This, in turn, allows us to assist our customers faster than the conventional &ldquo;over the cube wall&rdquo; method. This is a change that we have welcomed and will most likely continue to use moving forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Another significant improvement relates to the newfound culture that Support Center management has been promoting which is to &ldquo;use your best judgement&rdquo; and that &ldquo;making a mistake is ok.&rdquo; Early in the pandemic, management and leads had their capabilities stretched and didn&rsquo;t have answers readily available for all the things that had popped up. HD1 members, specifically, had to rely more on guidelines and were encouraged to choose the best course of action for their trouble ticket. This has instilled confidence in some HD1 members to take initiative and promote a culture of incrementally getting better through mistakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img title=""Emptiness outside the 1900 Building"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=796172"" alt=""Empty outside the 1900 building which used to be filled with people"" width=""400"" height=""533.333333333"" /></p>
<p><em>Pictured: The outside of the 1900 building along SW 4<sup>th</sup> avenue. Empty &ndash; Normally filled with students, members of the public, and city employees.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite enjoying the shorter commute times, we all miss each other as interactions via online do not hold up to in-person interaction. I, personally, long for the day when Portland&rsquo;s streets are filled once again with bustling crowds and we can all safely return to see our coworkers.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/796173
BTS Blog,796001,Microsoft Audio Licenses,1,,2021-09-10 23:20:57 UTC,2021-09-10 19:27:00 UTC,A,,"<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">Several Bureaus in the City opted for their users who did not previously have an Microsoft Audio license to participate in a promotional offer from Microsoft which added thousands of free Audio licenses to our account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why would I want an MS Audio license?</strong></p>
<p>This may be just what you never knew you wanted&hellip; If you ever schedule meetings in Outlook, whether with just one other customer, peer, or manager/supervisor, or with a group of folks, MS audio will add a nice call-in option for all attendees. This comes in handy if one of the attendees doesn&rsquo;t have access to a computer or the Teams apps as it lets them join the meeting with any phone. It also is useful where an attendee is having bandwidth/connection or audio issues. That person can still use a computer for the video part of the meeting in Teams while using a phone for audio so they have the full screen-sharing experience with better sound.</p>
<p>Here is how Audio looks in a meeting:</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=796003"" alt=""how Audio looks in a Teams meeting invite"" width=""450"" height=""159.880239521"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>But Teams meetings weren&rsquo;t so great last time I tried it! What if I prefer Zoom or another platform? </strong></p>
<p>While Teams was already awesome for 1-on-1 meetings or for small groups, it did have some limitations at the beginning of this pandemic that made people choose other meeting platforms. If you haven&rsquo;t checked it out lately, I invite you to give it another chance. Microsoft has made a number of significant improvements to their program over the last year-and-a-half including hosting large meeting sizes and facilitating break-out rooms. And unlike the other meeting platforms, you don&rsquo;t have to pay extra to use Teams because it is included with your Office 365 account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve never used Teams much, how do I learn how to use Teams better? </strong></p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t used Teams yet, there is so much more to it than meetings. It would be well worth your time to learn more about using this collaboration and productivity environment.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to get started:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><a href=""https://app.quickhelp.com/PortlandOregon"">QuickHelp</a> includes some great training and is delivered in small increments so you can easily go through it at your own pace without missing where you left off</li>
<li>There are specific help articles to be found if you search on the BTS <a href=""https://help.portlandoregon.gov/"">Technology Help Portal</a></li>
<li>There are numerous resource, tips-n-tricks, articles, and videos you can find with a quick internet search</li>
<li>Ask others in BTS how they use Teams</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if I don&rsquo;t end up using my MS Audio license? </strong></p>
<p>That is perfectly fine. You have the option to use it because you have a free license now, but there is no obligation. If you don&rsquo;t end up using it, then we will not renew your MS Audio license in 2024. If you retire or otherwise move on between now and then, your license will automatically be returned to the license pool. This is a no-risk opportunity so give it a try on your next Teams meeting.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/796001

BTS Blog,781551,To The Top of Goat Mountain – Portland’s highest Public Safety radio site,1,,2021-02-25 23:44:09 UTC,2021-02-25 23:26:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=781550"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""237"" /></em></p>
<p><em>By Kevin Novak</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critical repair work was completed at our Goat Mountain location in late February that necessitated a trip by snowmobile to the site by Kelly Bond and Kevin Novak of BTS&rsquo;s Public Safety Technology Division.&nbsp; Work was hampered by the fact that the area is located within the vicinity to where the wildfires of 2020 burned.&nbsp; The forest service has temporarily closed access to the public to the area until mid-summer due to possible landslides.&nbsp; After the arrival of the rangers to open the gate we proceeded on wet pavement to where the snowline was and prepared to transfer our tools and equipment to a snowmobile sled &ndash; but not before placing it all into thick trash bags to keep everything dry.</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=781552"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""236.979166667"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before departing, &nbsp;we all received a job briefing on safety equipment, use of the snowmobiles, and hand signals.&nbsp; Then it was time to dawn our thick jackets, helmets, and gloves and begin up the mountain.&nbsp; The road at the beginning was a bit rough with patches of asphalt and light snow, but then after about 5 minutes we proceeded onto thick enough snow where the snowmobiles could really do their job well!&nbsp; Our final turn off the main road to the site, about a mile and a half, was where we encountered the thickest snowfall on this last, steep ascent.&nbsp; The thin &lsquo;canyon&rsquo; the trees created allowed the winters snow to pile up and remain &ndash; with thicknesses approaching 3-4 feet.</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=781558"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""1054.94505495"" /></p>
<p>Once at the site the task of just opening the security fence was a challenge - not to mention keeping a careful lookout for falling ice/snow from the towers that were basking in the warm sunlight.&nbsp; After making it inside the facility we proceeded to repair our radio infrastructure, and to warm up.&nbsp; We swapped on-site equipment to begin the process of restoring radio service, verified the equipment was functioning, and packed up our gear and proceeded back down the hill in the cold and darkening skies to our vehicles for the drive back to the shop.</p>

<p>The POWR (Portland Oregon Website Replacement) project achieved an important milestone this month, as the entirety of the City of Portland Charter and Code as well as Portland Policy Documents is now on Portland.gov.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a title=""https://www.portland.gov/charter"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.portland.gov/charter"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">City of Portland Charter<br /></a></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>This work is a huge win for government transparency and accessibility. The new format makes these important documents so much easier to search and browse. Our web editors will also be able to relate the appropriate charter, code, or policies to other content on the site such as services and guides. The new system also gives us the ability to see recent and upcoming changes to these documents alongside the currently published version. (See an example with&nbsp;<a title=""https://www.portland.gov/code/30/01/140"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.portland.gov/code/30/01/140"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">30.01.140</a>.)</p>
<p>What was previously a largely ad hoc process involving the capture of documents via MS Word, subsequent distribution and review of PDFs by bureau stakeholders, the process of capture, review, and approval is now fully encapsulated within Portland.gov. Add to that, significant improvements in Search now specific to Charter, Code, and Policy on Portland.gov will provide a much improved end user experience to City staff and residents of Portland.&nbsp;You can now search all&nbsp;<a title=""https://www.portland.gov/charter-code-policies"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.portland.gov/charter-code-policies"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">charter, code, and policies on Portland.gov</a>&nbsp;for example.&nbsp;</p>

BTS Blog,779010,Updated BTS Outage Communication Process,1,,2020-12-01 20:53:13 UTC,2020-12-01 19:10:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Elyse Rosenberg</em></p>
<h1>What is the Issue?</h1>
<p>Have you ever asked yourself:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>How do customer bureaus get notified when a BTS service fails?</li>
<li>Why does it take so long for outage notifications to be sent?</li>
<li>Can I get an update on an outage without delaying the repair work?</li>
<li>Yeah, I&rsquo;m having that problem too!&nbsp; Should I do anything?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Answering these questions and other similar ones has been challenging because we needed a more simplified, streamlined process with a clearer definition of roles.&nbsp; We intuitively knew what needed to be done, but the road to get there may have been different based on who took ownership of the situation.</p>
<h1>How Did We Respond?</h1>
<p>A team was created to look at the existing process and recommend changes.&nbsp; The goals of the team were:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>A clear, simplified, and repeatable process</li>
<li>Well defined roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>More timely announcement of service impacting outages</li>
<li>Effective announcements, updates, and closure</li>
</ul>
<p>The team studied outages from across the bureau in an attempt to identify inefficiencies and lessons learned.&nbsp; There were key findings that the team was able to use, along with some best practice guidelines, to identify specific changes.</p>
<h1>What was the Result of Our Effort?</h1>
<p>The team identified four key roles necessary for each outage and a detailed plan to effectively communicate outages to leadership, to employees within BTS, and outward to bureaus and other consumers of BTS services. BTS Leadership and each service-owning team have been briefed and given the opportunity to learn and practice the new process. This updated <a href=""/bts/article/767568"">BTS Service Outage Communication Process</a> document will be the formal plan for communicating outages going forward.</p>
<p>With these process improvements you should see:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>More timely announcements about outages that all come from the BTS HelpDesk e-mail account;</li>
<li>A clear and consistent format for the message that provides the known impact of the outage in addition to identifying what service is affected;</li>
<li>Status updates on the <a href=""https://portlandoregon.cherwellondemand.com"">Technology Portal</a>, at least once per day, and more often when significant information is discovered.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<h1>Future Improvements</h1>
<p>We recognize that this will be an iterative process that continues to evolve to meet the demands of those affected by unplanned service outages.&nbsp; As the process is perfected, the team will be looking to extend the functionality to 1) after-hour outages;&nbsp; 2) assist service owners who have traditionally managed their own communication process (EBS, Public Safety, and Non-BTS teams); and 3) clarify the process for cloud service outages currently owned by a vendor.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/779010

<p>Wearing everything from pink shirts and socks to pink hats and masks, members of every BTS team participated to make this day a success &ndash; and a lot of fun! Here&rsquo;s a small sample from Communications, the HelpDesk, Production Services, Printing &amp; Distribution, Enterprise Business Solutions, Public Safety Technology, and Business Solutions!

<p>The MapWorks application is completely designed, programmed and deployed by CGIS staff in partnership with GIS professionals working in bureaus throughout the City.&nbsp; The intent of the application is to provide a light GIS client that allows users to query and interact with spatial data directly along with a set of productivity tools used to help automate common tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Users can use the tools to access yearly air photo flights going back to the mid 90&rsquo;s, search for properties, find intersections and select features by creating buffers or ad hoc polygons.&nbsp;&nbsp; MapWorks also uses data from API&rsquo;s created for Portlandmaps to integrate non spatial datasets like permits and assessor information, scanned documents tied to GIS features and even create formatted mailing lists for any area.&nbsp;&nbsp; MapWorks has a familiar desktop GIS interface but with a simplified set of menus and toolbars to make it easy to learn and use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>MapWorks 3.0</p>
<p>The newest version of MapWorks replaces two earlier versions with a completely reworked codebase.&nbsp;&nbsp; The previous version relied on documents authored in an older version of ESRI&rsquo;s desktop software, was cumbersome to install and used development tools that were no longer supported.&nbsp; It also required connection to CGIS SQL Servers to access data or used large local datasets which meant it did not work well outside the city network.</p>
<p>The new version utilizes the latest ESRI Runtime SDK and a more contemporary programming framework making it easy to install and update.&nbsp; The Runtime SDK also has a free tier which means that MapWorks so it can be used as widely as possible without increasing licensing costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly it uses web-based data provided through spatially enable REST endpoints assembled in web maps and distributed through an on-premise GIS content management system.&nbsp; This allows users to access data anywhere they have a web connection &ndash; at work, at home or in the field.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, there is a set of web applications that allow GIS support staff to customize the set of maps available to workgroups, control access to tools and track usage.</p>
<p>This new architecture proved particularly important when the city moved to full time telework for thousands of staff members on short notice earlier this year.&nbsp; Building on these new architectural structures a new version was deployed that allowed users to install the application on any Windows machine, receive automatic updates and access GIS data without a VPN connection or administrative privileges.&nbsp; This has helped keep city staff productive working in this new work environment while decreasing the load on our VPN infrastructure.</p>

<p>This project was a true team effort that involved everyone in the CGIS Program as well as Vertical Applications staff working in the bureaus.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to thank &ndash; Mike Quetel, Mitch Vanderperren, Ryan Chen, Kellie Gulden, Aaron Kilbey, Paul Cone, Tammy Dong, and Trevor Smith as well as Jake Brown and Andrew Neuman in Vertical Applications.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/763639
BTS Blog,761179,My Week at the Emergency Coordination Center (ECC) as Incident Commander,1,,2020-05-20 00:18:44 UTC,2020-05-19 14:00:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Jeff Baer</em></p>
<p>As Incident Commander you are involved in all the various sections from logistics, coordination, planning, operations, finance, safety, and public information. There are many moving pieces to working in the operations center and a large part of it involves being able to triage and assign issues to different sections to follow up and coordinate a response. It&rsquo;s an open floor and many breakout rooms to work through issues as they come forward.</p>
<p>The ECC is organized around the FEMA Incident Command System. If you are interested in learning more about this, please visit the FEMA website at:</p>
<p><a href=""https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-100.c"">https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-100.c</a></p>
<p>The day starts off with signing in, getting your temperature taken, washing your hands and making sure your workstation is cleaned and ready for use. You then begin a series of meetings starting with a Command Staff meeting to find out what new information or events have happened overnight and discuss what may be coming up during the day followed by a staff briefing from each Section Chief. Sometimes you are tracking people down, scheduling meetings, attending meetings, making phone calls, finding who has answers to questions, following up to receive a status report and of course reading and replying to emails. At the end of the day you finish with a report out from each Section Chief on what they worked on which then gets placed in a daily events log or situation status report. The day goes by very quickly. Working in the ECC has been educational and provided opportunities for collaboration with other bureaus. It was an honor and a privilege to be the Incident Commander for a week and to work with so many dedicated individuals who are helping us through this crisis.</p>
<p>Please consider applying for an ECC position and talk to your manager. Not only will you learn new skills, but you&rsquo;ll also become much more knowledgeable about the City&rsquo;s role in responding to this crisis.</p>

<h3>Portland Oregon Website Replacement POWR &ndash; Rick Nixon</h3>
<p>The POWR project, one of the City&rsquo;s top 3 technology projects, was started in January 2018 and is expected to continue through December 2020. The goal of the POWR project is to retire our aging in-house developed content management system and associated technologies with that of a proven world-class platform called Drupal. Drupal is a free and open-source content management framework used for more than a million websites across the globe, including government websites, ranging from the governments of Australia to Multnomah County right here at home.</p>
<p>The vision of the POWR project is to build a website for our community where services and information are easy to find, access, and understand. 'Easy to find' will rely on much improved search and browsing capabilities. 'Easy to access' not only refers to ADA compliance for assistive technologies, but also by device type, of which, mobile represents ~50% of our users. And lastly, 'easy to understand' requires not only reducing the sheer amount of content, but also lessening the cognitive effort required by writing the content to be targeted at a fifth to eighth grade reading level.</p>
<p>In the first few months of 2018 , the eGov team and a few other BTS inductees set off to identify our development process and related &rsquo;toolchain&rsquo;, the collection of tools and technologies in support of team development and collaboration. We are now set to begin sprint 27, our 3 week development cycle to deliver continued incremental features and functionality.</p>
<p>Existing tools and applications expected to be impacted by the POWR project effort include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decommissioning of TrackIt, the City&rsquo;s in-house developed webform and ticketing system. We are pursuing a suite of cloud-based tools as an overall replacement of TrackIt, including Drupal webforms, Zendesk, SeamlessDocs, and DocuSign depending on the level of sensitivity surrounding the type of information being transmitted to the City.</li>
<li>Decommissioning of existing user accounts on the current website, PortlandOregon.gov by moving to a cloud-based CIAM (Customer Identity Access Management) solution in support of an authentication only approach to user identity. User authorization will continue be referred to the respective applications involved for actions allowed within those applications.</li>
<li>Migration of existing applications away from the City&rsquo;s historic ColdFusion platform to that of Drupal or other appropriate technologies. While not specifically in scope by the December 2020 timeline, there are over 70 applications that will need to be retired or migrated away from our ColdFusion platform over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also proactively working with staff of elected officials, bureaus and offices by holding content workshops whereby we recommend, guide and track their progress of migrating existing and creating new content in support of an overall data-driven user experience, allowing for superior search and relationships between content for end users.</p>
<p>For more information, please check out the City&rsquo;s beta site, <a href=""http://beta.portland.gov"">beta.portland.gov</a>&nbsp;and let us know your thoughts at <a href=""mailto:powr@portlandoregon.gov"">powr@portlandoregon.gov</a></p>
<h3>New Service &ndash; Electronic Signatures (eSignatures) &ndash; Rick Schulte</h3>
<p>BTS will soon be offering a new service to Bureau customers in the form of Electronic Signatures and Workflow. The selected platform is DocuSign which has been configured to manage the City of Portland Organization with Bureaus administrating and supporting their own business processes. DocuSign has also been integrated with Active Directory to provide Single Sign On or SSO authentication.</p>
<p>This new service is designed to make signing documents easy, secure, efficient and fast greatly reducing the time and effort to route and get signatures for City staff and the Citizens of Portland. BES, PBOT, OMF have already been using DocuSign and there is a high demand for this service across the City.</p>
<p>Information on how to obtain this new service will be available at <a href=""/esign"">www.portlandoregon.gov/esign</a></p>

<h3>Portland Online Permitting System (POPS) - Kevin York and Saby Waraich</h3>
<p>The Portland Online Permitting (POPS) program is modernizing our current permitting system into an online, enhanced customer service delivery system.</p>
<p>Currently, permit technicians input all permit application information into TRACS, a system the City has used to track and manage permits since 1999. This technology supports the development permit process, but it's antiquated and relies heavily on inefficient paper-based transactions.</p>
<p>POPS is comprised of six distinct workstreams, including:</p>
<h4>AMANDA</h4>
<ul>
<li>AMANDA is the backbone of the city&rsquo;s permitting system. City of Portland staff use the AMANDA application to track and process permit applications. Upgrading AMANDA is technically a migration of all the data in our old version to the new version (AMANDA 7). The AMANDA Migration upgrades the City&rsquo;s permitting process from desktop database software that has been in use since 1999 to modern, web-based software. This foundational upgrade retains the functionality of the original database and business processes, providing us a solid base on which we can improve. By upgrading to the newest version, we can continue to expand the current functionality and improve the AMANDA user experience. Our old system is unsupported, and the upgrade will better protect the data.</li>
<li>Schedule extended to Q1 2020; project plan being aligned with vendor release plan, adding support, communications, functional readiness and training to plan, to determine optimal timing for rollout that will be least disruptive. Requirements to finalize schedule and rollout still in development.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Development Hub PDX</h4>
<ul>
<li>Development Hub PDX (DevHub) is a website developed and maintained by the City of Portland Bureau of Development Services. It provides a quick, easy alternative for contractors and homeowners to purchase simple permits from several bureaus that do not require plan review.</li>
<li>Launched Development Hub PDX (DevHub) on July 1, 2019. Officially retired the legacy system Permits Online on August 2, 2019. All activity now routed through DevHub.</li>
<li>Postponed DevHub build out in Portland.gov, the new City website design. Will launch in current web platform instead to benefit customer transition to new look/feel.</li>
</ul>
<h4>PDX ePlans</h4>
<ul>
<li>PDX ePlans is the Bureau of Development Services&rsquo; (BDS) electronic plan review and document management system. Using a web-based tool called &rsquo;ProjectDox&rsquo;, ePlans provides a convenient central hub for development project groups (including applicants and City reviewers) to communicate and complete the entire plan review process online. Staff at BDS and our partner bureaus can review the plans simultaneously on their computer screens. And if customers need to make a correction to their plans, they can submit those corrections online for re-review, saving a trip to the Development Services Center.</li>
<li>Co-Sponsor &amp; TOC approved PDX ePlans graduation from the original project scope / Phase I.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Inspection Scheduling</h4>
<p>Inspection Scheduling automates the manual process of scheduling daily inspections and assigning them to individual inspectors. Manual scheduling takes time, requires inspectors to come into the office to receive their assignments, and delays the inspectors&rsquo; ability to begin their work in the field. Automated Inspection Scheduling using the AMANDA database will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of scheduling and assigning daily commercial, residential, and enforcement inspections.</p>
<p>Benefits of automated Inspection Scheduling include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize the number of inspections that can be assigned in a day</li>
<li>Enable inspectors to begin their work earlier in the day</li>
<li>Reduce the consumption of paper by routing inspection assignments to the mobile Inspector App</li>
<li>Support dynamic updates to inspections and inspector information from the field or office</li>
</ul>
<h4>Inspector App</h4>
<p>The inspector App is a new tool that allows resulting inspections in real-time from a mobile device. Our current paper-based inspection forms consume valuable time and slow down inspectors as they work to complete daily assignments. Inspectors will be able to enter inspection results, photos, comments and other items into AMANDA from the field instead of having to wait to transcribe their update when they return to the office. With the app, inspectors can look up information from a mobile device to inform inspection decisions, and along the way, they can use the routing feature in the app to help them plan their stops in the most efficient way. Inspectors can record code violations and accept signatures in real-time while in the field with customers.</p>
<h4>Contractor App</h4>
<p>The Contractor App enables customers to view their permits, permit details, and the status of inspections online. It also allows customers to receive text messages (SMS) and email notifications regarding the status of their inspections and inspection results. Customers will gain time savings and improved transparency by being able to self-source this information using their mobile devices. While this information will also be available on the Development Hub, this app adds notification in a mobile-friendly way.</p>
<h4>Where can I learn more about AMANDA and POPS?</h4>
<p>You can find informational videos about AMANDA and the other POPS workstreams on the Bureau of Development Services YouTube channel. Head to youtube.com/BDSOutreach to watch and learn.</p>
<h3>Portland Bureau of Transportation Maximo Upgrade &ndash; Todd Watson</h3>
<p>The BTS Vertical Applications team in conjunction with the PBOT Technology Services team and IBM Maximo Consultants from Banetti are upgrading PBOT&rsquo;s Maximo 7.1 system to version 7.6 to address Windows Server compliance issues, improve usability, adopt industry best practices for asset management, and incorporate enhancements in alignment with PBOT&rsquo;s Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>One of the major challenges is that previous deployments of Maximo for PBOT have utilized extensive custom Java class extensions to accommodate multiple customer requests for custom features. Through a combination of process analysis and improvements with the PBOT business systems analysts and our Banetti consultant as well as new system features provided out-of-the-box, we have reduced the number of customized Java class extension files from 195 to 0. This is a major improvement for our overall ability to support, configure, and upgrade the system in the future.</p>
<p>Our current status is that we have build our dev, test and production systems and configured them for UAT of the Maximo user interface to begin the week of October 7th. End-to-end testing, which includes external interfaces to SAP and GIS systems, will occur throughout the month of November. Our currently scheduled go-live date is December 2, 2019.</p>
<h3>Corporate GIS Program Update &ndash; Matt Freid</h3>
<p>Corporate has several major projects going on now and into 2020. We are working with our bureau partners and the System Engineering Team to upgrade all the over 1,000 ArcGIS Desktop clients in the city to the latest version of the software. We are now in beta testing for the newest version of our MapWorks GIS client used to query and view spatial data. The new version will use web services to allow users to access GIS data with just an internet client wherever they are. The team also has lots of projects with bureaus to implement mobile applications, data visualization, and web GIS technology.</p>
<h3>Business Solutions Manager Update &ndash; Dan Bauer</h3>
<p>Additionally, as was announced previously, Dan Bauer is providing oversight of the Business Solutions division during the BSD manager. This will continue during the fall and winter while our bureau focuses on the move back to the Portland Building planned for fall 2019. As we move on to 2020 the next steps for filling that vacancy will be shared across BTS. In the meantime, if you have any ideas for process improvement or how to more efficiently and effectively deliver services in Business Solutions, or any BTS division please let me know. I am always impressed to hear the great ideas that smart and creative BTS employees have to improve our organization.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/747469

<p><em>By Ashish Gupta</em></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">While walking to office this morning, I was listening to the thoughts of the Indian guru and life coach, Gaur Gopal Das. The essence of his lecture was that it's our generation's responsibility and a failure of humanity if the next generation is not better than the current generation. I was thinking after listening to this lecture that the world needs to practice Equity and not equality to make the world a better place for next generation. &nbsp;We must ask ourselves what kind of legacy do we want to leave for our children?</span></p>
<p>The Northwest Public Employee Diversity Conference was held on October 8th, 2019. Thanks to our bureau leadership, we had an opportunity to send 15 staff from BTS. This action demonstrates that Equity and Diversity are a priority to BTS leadership. Below are the experiences/lessons shared by some of the conference attendees.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Phong Nguyen - Support Center</span></strong></p>
<p>Overall, it was a good experience. I got to meet people from different agencies and learned some personal and organizational stories. I also learned about how to be an accomplice with your coworkers. Be willing to take action and put your job/career on the line to do what is right. It is challenging for me to take more risks in order to make the workplace a better experience for us all. I have to be the bridge and be able to feel comfortable to discuss all things. But most of all, empathy plays a huge role when dealing with people.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Andy Dhillon - Support Center</span></strong></p>
<p>I have learned the importance of understanding Microaggressions in a diverse workplace. How small unintentional comments or gestures could impact someone who comes from different backgrounds or cultures. These unintentional impacts sometimes leave a long-lasting impression on a person's thought process and self-confidence. In our efforts to build an equitable workplace, I think it is essential to educate ourselves and everyone around us regarding Microaggressions. We need to be aware, supportive, and, most important, be ready to take necessary steps to ensure that our workplace is safe from physical, verbal, and mental abuse. Sometimes it seems to easy, but I learned from my personal experience that I been using certain words that could be offensive to some people. These work sessions really helped me build a more open and aware mental outlook on these things.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Holly Swan - Support Center</span></strong></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of attending the Northwest Public Employees Diversity Conference for the third time. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to attend this event again this year. I always walk away feeling uplifted, encouraged, and challenged in new ways to do better. There were two things that really stuck with me after I left the conference. The first is that it is very important to know your own story, where you come from, and how that relates to the dominant culture of where you are. The second thing I learned was how the power of sharing your story with others and listening to theirs could create empathy and inspire positive change.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Paul Gamboa - Project Management Office</span></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In regards to the event, I was surprised by how late many government organizations are in coming to the table to engage in areas of Diversity. Many folks I engaged with were just beginning to understand the issues, and their departments were just starting committees. Each group indicated that there were tangible concerns in their departments.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Patti Midland - Business Engagement &amp; Strategic Technology</span></strong></p>
<p>The theme for this year's Diversity conference was ""Leading with Racial Equity through Action and Accountability."" During the conference, speakers stressed the importance of being leaders in bringing equity into the workplace, regardless of job title, and shared examples of how individuals can make a difference in transforming the culture to embrace Diversity. Though there were many great speakers and a variety of important topics, my personal favorite was Parfait Bassale. Parfait grew up in a non-racialized native West Africa and spoke about his move to the United States. He described the challenges he encountered as he interacted with Americans as a new immigrant as a long journey of self-discovery. Puzzled by the human tendency to zero in on the things that are different in others rather than their similarities, he enrolled in a conflict resolution program in college. In the course of his studies, he researched empathy and realized it was the missing link that, if achieved by opposing sides, could solve all conflicts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Parfait explained the ""Be the Bridge"" model, which is a framework to guide engagement in social justice and equity work:</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">B</span></strong>e Authentic &ndash; Allow people to show up as they are. Be you. Respect others.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">R</span></strong>elationships &ndash; People are most likely to form their most intimate relationships with people like themselves. We need to take intentional steps to interact with others that aren't like us and build those relationships to gain perspective from other points of view. Include everyone. Limiting relationships to only people that share our point of view builds an ""us vs. them"" mentality.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">I</span></strong>ntrospect &ndash; Examine your thoughts and feelings. We have ownership of how we experience things/people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">D</span></strong>iscuss all things &ndash; Discuss the uncomfortable. Learning happens when we are the most uncomfortable. Be humble when we hear people tell their stories. Don't minimize what they are saying.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">G</span></strong>ift your story &ndash; Be vulnerable. Sharing your story transforms relationships.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">E</span></strong>mpathy - Communicate from a place of understanding with the intent of moving toward more understanding. Find the counter-perspectives. Empathy is learned, not innate.</p>
<p>The overall message from participants was the importance to be a champion for others. Using our scope of influence, we can create change and remove barriers, make space for others to share their thoughts and perspectives and help them find their voice, &nbsp;and be the change you want to see.

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: #1c1e29;"">While working outside on my deck, I had a flashback of earlier days of my career working as a software engineer. I used to wonder how organizations make decisions on which projects to pursue. There are so many opportunities but limited resources. In this blog post, I am sharing a contribution our team makes towards providing information for selecting BTS top projects.&nbsp;<!--?xml:namespace prefix = ""o"" ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /--></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: #1c1e29;"">The Business Engagement and Technology Strategy (BETS) team, which includes Technology Business Consultants (TBCs) and Enterprise Architecture (EA), developed a tool and process to capture technology projects coming our way from customers. We call this tool the Technology Planner. Each TBC reaches out to the bureaus/offices in their portfolios to obtain the information about technology needs and initiatives.&nbsp; We collect information like the business problem, what success looks like, bureau priority, known BTS resources, and chances of moving the project forward. This planner becomes an information source for the selection of top projects at the Technology Executive Steering Committee (TESC). Last year we captured more than 140 potential customers projects for the next 1-5 years. This year we already have 150+ in the list with one more quarter to go. Approximately half of this year&rsquo;s potential projects were carried forward from last year. The tool and the process is in the early stage of development as we work towards our team focus of being strategic. I will share more in future blog posts as we develop the tool further and refine our process.</span></p>

<p>Communications has some exciting news to share. I would like to highlight work completed at the Portland Building as of yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Network team finished all switch installations! From the basement to the rooftop (B &ndash; 16) all floors are online! To get to this point, many staff throughout BTS have put in long hours planning, ordering, measuring, configuring and threading cabling to install our infrastructure foundation.</p>
<p>There are more long days to come, involving all of the teams across our bureau. Please join me in celebrating this first major milestone.</p>
<p>On behalf of the BTS Leadership team, we offer our thanks for the dedication and hard work to date.</p>

<p>I was flipping through my Speed of Trust cards; I stumbled through ""Get Better"" card. The card is about continuous improvement and acts upon feedback received. Even though we have been running the Customer Stakeholder Group (CSG) meetings for a long time, we still solicit customer feedback at every meeting.&nbsp; One customer reached out to us requesting visibility into BTS&rsquo;s project load and high priority projects. Based on the customer feedback, we created the ""BTS Priority Project Dashboard,"" that we can share at every CSG meeting.</p>
<p>The dashboard has two components, a high-level view of BTS Project Portfolio, and quick status updates on Programs/Projects prioritized by the TESC (Technology Executive Steering Committee). &nbsp;Below is a screenshot of our August dashboard.</p>
<p><a href=""/bts/article/741038""><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=741034"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""266"" /></a></p>
<p>The left-hand side of the dashboard provides information on all the active projects, the pending projects (projects with no project manager assigned), and the projects that are scheduled to close in the current quarter.</p>
<p>The table on the right-hand side of the dashboard provides programs in the TESC&rsquo;s priority order, and the health of the projects under each program. The health indicator follows the standard project indicators of red, yellow, and green. Red means the project is in trouble, yellow means the project in trouble but can get back on track, and green means the project is on track. We added an empty box for projects that are not started yet and a black filled box for the project that just started, but they are not at a point yet to provide a health status. The dashboard reflects two projects not yet started, and one of them is scheduled to begin this quarter. The last two columns provide information on whether the project is in progress or starting or ending in the current quarter.</p>
<p>We have heard from many folks, including folks from BTS, that the CSG is one of the most informational meetings that they attend. We received a suggestion to share this dashboard and CSG content with the rest of BTS &ndash; this blog post is the start of us doing so monthly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We like to keep getting better. If you have attended a CSG meeting and have feedback, please provide feedback by filling out the survey at <a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CSG-Feedback"">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CSG-Feedback</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2019 BTS Customer Survey Results</strong></p>
<p>Each year, BTS surveys Bureau Directors, Bureau Liaisons, Budget Managers, and other key contacts about our services.&nbsp; The goal of the survey is to gather feedback from key customers about BTS as a provider of technology leadership and vision for the city and BTS as a technology service provider.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s survey was open from May 16, 2019 through June 7, 2019.&nbsp; We received 99 complete responses from folks in 27 different bureaus.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re honored that 99 people cared enough about our service and partnership to spend 10-15 minutes giving us feedback.&nbsp; Now we need to use that valuable feedback.</p>
<p>Last week, we shared a summary of results and our intended next steps with the BTS Leadership Team and with our Customer Stakeholder Group (CSG).&nbsp; We also wanted to share a few highlights with BTS as a whole.&nbsp; You can view the full presentation to the CSG <a href=""/bts/article/737952"">here</a> if you&rsquo;re interested in more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A few highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>BTS strives to provide technology leadership in support of the City&rsquo;s business.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; 42% of respondents think BTS does an extremely effective or very effective job at this from the Citywide perspective.&nbsp; Another 43% think BTS is somewhat effective at this.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; 45% of respondents think BTS does an extremely effective or very effective job at this for their Bureau.&nbsp; Another 44% think BTS is somewhat effective at this.</li>
<li>74% of respondents understand <a href=""/omf/article/709670"">BTS&rsquo;s priorities and roadmap for technology</a> over the next year.&nbsp;</li>
<li>92% of respondents agree that &ldquo;BTS provides value to my bureau&rdquo; and 83% said they are satisfied overall with BTS&rsquo;s contribution to their bureau.</li>
<li>Customers were asked to tell us about their satisfaction level with 15 services.&nbsp; On a scale of 1 to 4, these services were rated between a 3.3 and a 2.6.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>BTS Leadership and those responsible for services are reviewing detailed feedback and comments.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve committed to making improvement plans for services with an average satisfaction rating below 3.0 on a scale of 1 to 4.&nbsp;</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll be coming back to our Customer Stakeholder Group later this year with more information about those improvement plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the survey points to several opportunities for improvement, many customers also took time to say how much the value and appreciate the work you do every day.&nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp; Your efforts are noticed &ndash; keep it up and help us continue to Get Better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today I was honored to represent the BTS Employee Recognition Committee in awarding the first ever BTS Trust Star Award to Mike Lamb. The Employee Recognition Committee added the BTS Trust Star as a way to acknowledge people in BTS who exemplify Trust behavior and uphold Trust core principles.</p>
<p>It was unanimously easy for the team to decide that Mike Lamb should be our inaugural recipient. Not only is Mike a high trust individual but he also worked to get our All Access Pass program up and running&nbsp;so we could enjoy the amazing content. Mike also regularly demonstrates respect to others, listens first, keeps commitments and operates with high capability and integrity.&nbsp;In other words, Mike truly ""walks the walk and talks the talk"" when it comes to Trust.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mike, for all you have done for the Speed of Trust Program and for building trust in BTS.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/736222

<p>Today I had the distinct honor of passing along the SuperStar&trade; award to a worthy successor, Shawna Graber. Shawna has been instrumental in the success of multiple, critical procurements tied to several City initiatives. A few notables include helping us deliver the infrastructure related to the POPS program, ensuring purchasing vehicles were in place for critical IBM renewals (which saved the City money!), and helping us annually navigate the murky waters of Oracle procurement. There are many more ways in which she has helped create success for my group, but I particularly appreciate her attitude when unexpected &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; arise and her willingness to work with others whose knowledge of the intricacies of purchasing may be more elementary.</p>
<p>I want to thank Shawna for the work she&rsquo;s done with us so far and look forward to working with her in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you Shawna.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/733961

With the use of Tableau, the committee was able to develop a highly dynamic dashboard that visualizes the different stages of the application process, the demographics of all job applicants, and how that trend has changed/become static. Tableau&rsquo;s advanced filtering functionality then allows users to drilldown to a granular level to get a closer look at the data.

BTS Blog,711881,Technology Portal & Service Catalog Updates – February 11!,1,,2019-02-07 19:42:28 UTC,2019-02-07 01:07:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Elyse Rosenberg</em></p>
<p><strong>Technology Portal &amp; Service Catalog Updates &ndash; February 11!</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that BTS is refreshing our Service Catalog and the Technology Portal?&nbsp; This effort has been happening since mid-2018 and has involved representatives from every BTS Division.&nbsp; Our Service Catalog and enhancing the way customers engage with us are key elements of IT Service Management best practice.&nbsp; And, making it easier for customers to interact with BTS helps all of us spend more time on projects or solving problems rather than directing customers to the right place.&nbsp; The launch of the updated Service Catalog and soft launch of the updated Technology Portal is happening Monday, February 11!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s part of the new Technology Portal&rsquo;s home page:</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=711880"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""221"" /></p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s a Service Catalog?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way we communicate BTS&rsquo;s service offerings to our customers. It also drives how tickets are routed.&nbsp; Currently, we have some services and products described on our website and others programmed in Cherwell (our ticketing system) &ndash; and they don&rsquo;t match.&nbsp; With this refresh of the Service Catalog, your team representatives worked hard to categorize services in customer-friendly terms and in a way that the services listed in the Technology Portal directly tie to ticket routing in Cherwell.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the Technology Portal and why are we refreshing it?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The Technology Portal is a tool that customers can use to interact with BTS.&nbsp; Our goal is to build it into a one-stop resource for technology needs and questions.&nbsp; We have a portal now, but it&rsquo;s regularly used by fewer than 500 employees.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re refreshing the portal to help customers understand how to access our services and to provide more options for customers to solve their own problems.&nbsp; One key feature is easy access to a knowledge base of articles customers can use to self-serve.</p>
<p><strong>How will this impact me?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The look, feel, and functionality of the Technology Portal is changing, along with the desktop shortcut that takes customers to the portal. &nbsp;The Cherwell client look, feel, and functionality is <strong>NOT</strong> changing. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Ticket routing via Cherwell will change to reflect the new catalog.&nbsp; You will still have all the same tickets assigned to you/your team, but new tickets will come assigned with the new categories in the service catalog.</li>
<li>A new Cherwell form was created for tickets associated with applications. Thanks to lots of work with Business Solutions and Public Safety Technology, tickets submitted on this form will be automatically routed to the teams that can help with the application rather than first being triaged by the HelpDesk.</li>
<li>If you have built custom processes, custom dashboards, and searches in the Cherwell client that are tied to the Service Catalog, they may break because the catalog is changing.&nbsp; Most people have dashboards and searches associated with their teams rather than services, so this impact should be limited.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s next?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve been doing demos of the Technology Portal for BTS Teams. If you&rsquo;re interested and we haven&rsquo;t made it to your team yet, let us know!</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re going live with the updated Service Catalog and a soft launch of the Technology Portal on February 11, 2019.&nbsp; A soft launch means the Technology Portal will be in production, but we won&rsquo;t start marketing it broadly until it&rsquo;s stabilized, and we have initial feedback from those that use it frequently.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Future phases for the Technology Portal will include enhancements to current functions and integrating technology procurement functions.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll be exploring ways to add your team to those contributing knowledge articles to the knowledge base &ndash; both for your BTS colleagues to troubleshoot issues and for customers to self-serve.&nbsp; Right now, the knowledge based contains almost 300 articles for customer use and 2000+ for internal use.</li>

<p>The EBS team supports SAP, the City&rsquo;s enterprise solution that integrates information for financial, human resources, and procurement business processes.</p>
<p>Our team has been very busy over the past year with a variety of projects, most recently successfully completing our yearly patch cycle.&nbsp; To close out 2018, we also completed our year end HR updates and numerous changes that need to be in place to support the start of 2019 such as the vacation accrual changes and non-rep study implementation.&nbsp; Additionally, we partnered with the CBO and supported the interface development to the new budget software BFM, developed the B2G Now interface for payment information and are working with the Bureau of Revenue and Financial Services (BRFS) to schedule their prioritized projects.</p>
<p class=""cs2654ae3a"">In other notable news, Charlie Dudley, our Training and Development Officer, led the implementation effort of uPerform, a documentation tool launched officially in January 2018.&nbsp; All SAP support documents are being reauthored in the tool. The goal is to completely re-author all SAP support documents into the new format which is then tracked by the system for annual review and updating ensuring all documents are reviewed on a regular schedule.&nbsp; uPerform can also be used to create online course documents to embed in video lessons linked into the Learning Management System.&nbsp; Other bureaus are now actively utilizing uPerform for their documentation needs and it has been added to the BTS Standards Directory draft for Fall 2018 as a standard BTS offering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the strategic front - did you know that SAP&rsquo;s landscape and product roadmap has changed dramatically over the past several years?&nbsp; With the support of our CTO, Jeff Baer and Deputy CTO, Dan Bauer, we are partnering with our BTS Technology Business Consultants (TBC&rsquo;s) and our key Bureau stakeholders, to develop a very robust strategic project roadmap to better meet the needs of the City.&nbsp; Based on feedback, our goal is to improve the user experience, provide improved capabilities, and enhance system performance to improve overall satisfaction with SAP as a Citywide Enterprise Solution.</p>
<p>A key area on the roadmap for Human Resources (HCM) is the migration to SAP&rsquo;s SuccessFactors (SF).&nbsp; SF is a cloud-based offering that encompasses Talent Management, Core HR functionality and more robust analytics with an improved modern and intuitive user interface.</p>
<p>Our team, in partnership with the HR Training and Workforce Development team (TWD), implemented SuccessFactors Learning Management System in July which has provided increased flexibility for not only TWD and Citywide training offerings but allows for bureau specific training.&nbsp; Included are mobile capability, quarterly upgrades, virtual classroom training and a host of other improvements that better meet the needs of the City. This project also set up the SucessFactors platform, which will be used to access future modules.</p>
<p>Currently, the EBS and BHR teams are in the process of implementing the next two modules which are Performance and Goals Management and On-Boarding.&nbsp; We are extremely excited to partner with BHR to implement these new capabilities.&nbsp; It fully aligns with and supports the City of Portland&rsquo;s initiative to be the &lsquo;Employer of Choice&rsquo; and the goal to attract, develop and retain<strong> </strong>a diverse, culturally competent, fully engaged workforce<strong> </strong>providing excellent public services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the near future, we will be communicating more about our strategic roadmap including the move to HANA databases which will be a key initiative that provides a whole host of improved capabilities. &nbsp;Below is a subset of the overall benefits/capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real time<strong> </strong>information from transactional systems with less reliance on historical and duplicative data stores</li>
<li>Improved system performance</li>
<li>Modern user experience and responsive design including out of the box mobile capabilities</li>
<li>Increased self-service<strong> </strong>for reporting across the organization</li>
<li>Increased automation to reduce manual errors in the reporting process</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exciting time for our team as we see our strategic efforts moving forward.&nbsp; You know the saying, &lsquo;it takes a village&rsquo;. Fortunately, we have a &lsquo;village&rsquo; of support and help as part of the BTS team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to close this blog post by saying congratulations to Thang Ngo, a member of the EBS team who won 1<sup>st</sup> Place in the category of Designer&rsquo;s Choice at the 2018 Ninth Moon Floral Design Showcase - Lan Su Chinese Gardens.&nbsp; This event recognizes the floral art and creative talent of the region&rsquo;s top floral designers.&nbsp; If you visit BTS at the Columbia Square building &ndash; 4<sup>th</sup> floor, you will see examples of Thang&rsquo;s creative talents as he provides on-going floral displays for us all to enjoy!</p>
<p>Congratulations Thang!</p>

BTS Blog,705221,A Brief Tour of the P&D Shop,1,,2018-12-11 22:27:21 UTC,2018-12-03 20:14:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Paul Cone</em></p>
<p>Now that <a href=""/bts/27418"">Printing and Distribution</a> is formally part of the BTS family I decided to call up their manager Matthew Spitulski and arrange for a brief tour of their shop.</p>
<p>With the advent of electronic communications their business has changed but they continue to fill an important need for many City bureaus and their programs.&nbsp; You know those stickers on your recycling can at home that tell you what you can and can&rsquo;t put in there?&nbsp; P&amp;D prints those for BPS, who then delivers them to your hauler.&nbsp; Those orange PBOT <a href=""/transportation/article/669625"">20 is Plenty</a> yard signs?&nbsp; P&amp;D procured a vendor to make those.&nbsp; And of course the water and sewer bills and Arts Tax mailings are products of P&amp;D.&nbsp; Last year P&amp;D spent $1.9 million on postage for City of Portland mailings, at the 22 +/- cents for Standard mail and 38 cents for First Class letters.</p>
<p>P&amp;D has hosted open houses in the past, which have been popular.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t have one currently scheduled but in the meantime, here are some photos.</p>

BTS Blog,704644,Spotlight:  Server Team,1,,2018-11-28 19:26:53 UTC,2018-11-28 19:23:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Mike Lamb</em></p>
<p><strong>What do we do?</strong></p>
<p>The Server Team manages the BTS-supported server infrastructure for the City. We have over 600 servers we manage that are comprised of Windows, Red Hat Linux, and AIX operating systems that run a wide variety of services for the City. Whether you are sending email, drafting a document from a file share, or performing a task in one of the City enterprise systems, the Server Team plays a part in ensuring these systems are running effectively.</p>
<p>We also have a variety of tasks we perform in addition to building servers and addressing Cherwell tickets. We maintain the security compliance on servers, manage enterprise backups, support the emergency paging system, and manage the ROSE domain infrastructure, in addition to many other items.</p>
<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>The Server and Messaging Team is comprised of 12 team members that focus on two main areas: Windows server support and Unix server support.</p>
<p><img title=""Server Team"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=704645"" alt=""Server Team"" width=""500"" height=""375"" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Server Support: Omar Hernandez, Ali Karout (not pictured), David Carter, Mike Nichols, Ryan Ferris, Zane Mullan, Richard Buss, and Patrick Laprocina.</li>
<li>Unix Server Support: Patrick Springer, Tom Christian, Dawn Alderman, and Gary Gorski.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current Projects</strong></p>
<p>Here are some of the projects we are currently involved in:</p>
<ul>
<li>POPS: building servers, assisting the vendors with configuration changes, and ensuring the servers are operating smoothly.</li>
<li>Securing the Office 365 Tenant: currently working on configuring and deploying multifactor authentication (MFA) to the City and looking at further steps we can take to secure City data.</li>
<li>Data Center Move Phase 2: completing the build out of the secondary datacenter in Colorado.</li>
<li>Server 2008 Upgrade: replacing or upgrading all City servers still running Server 2008.</li>
<li>AIX Maintenance Windows: establishing AIX maintenance windows so we can establish consistent schedules for updating the servers, installing patches, or upgrading firmware on the hosts.</li>
<li>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Proof of Concept: working closely with the Systems Engineering Team to configure the VDI test environment to evaluate if the technology is one the City should invest in for the long term.</li>
<li>VCAD Upgrade: we are currently working with the VCAD Support Team to upgrade to VCAD 7.5.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Upcoming Projects</strong></p>
<p>We have several projects on the horizon and here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Print Infrastructure Management: This project is geared towards developing a print management solution that allows mobile customers to more easily find printers to use, take advantage of printing technologies like &ldquo;pull printing&rdquo;, and set up our print infrastructure to adapt to virtual desktops. We will be working closely with P&amp;D as well as the team involved in the move back into the Portland Building to align requirements.</li>
<li>Cloud Infrastructure Service Offering: We will be working with a few vendors to review their cloud service offering to see which ones best align with our requirements. The goal is to be able to provide an option for a virtual server in the cloud or on premise to our customers and to understand the cost difference of each one.</li>

<p>With several heat waves that came across the city this past summer, some BTS employees went to the Willamette river to cool off.&nbsp; Within a short walking distance from the Columbia Square building, boaters can launch their kayaks or paddleboards from the waterfront, paddle across the river to have lunch on the boating dock next to OMSI and get back within a lunch period.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a fun way to laugh and cool off during the hot weather.</p>
<p>I own&nbsp;a few kayaks and paddleboards, and&nbsp;also have access to rent additional boats. With my teenage sons, and their friends, I can load the boats and prepare them for a small teambuilding event. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s hope Portland will have another pleasant weather next summer.</p>

<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html"">American Cancer Society</a>, women in the US have a 1 in 8 chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetimes.&nbsp; In recognition of the impact breast cancer has had on our lives, BTS held Tech In Pink Day, challenging employees to wear pink on October 24 and donating on behalf of each person who did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tech In Pink Day was started by the IT Department of Est&eacute;e Lauder cosmetics.&nbsp; The company has a deep connection to the issue because Senior Vice President Evelyn Lauder survived breast cancer and helped to popularize the pink ribbon as a symbol for breast cancer awareness.&nbsp; Several BTS employees heard about Tech In Pink from Est&eacute;e Lauder&rsquo;s Chief Information Officer (CIO) at the recent CIO Forum in Portland and decided to give it a try in BTS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to 127 BTS employees and 6 BTS Liaisons who wore pink and 22 people who donated, $2,000 was raised for the <a href=""https://komenoregon.org/"">Susan G. Komen Foundation of Oregon and SW Washington</a>!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wearing everything from homemade pink ribbons to pink shirts and socks to pink wigs and hats, members of every BTS team participated to make this day a success &ndash; and a lot of fun!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a small sample from the Deployment Team, Deepak Madhavan (who wins for long-distance participation!), Public Safety Technology, Printing and Distribution, Saby and Jeff from POPS headquarters, the Communications Team, Enterprise Business Solutions, the Network Team, and Customer Relations/Enterprise Architecture.</p>

BTS Blog,700839,ADA Assistive Technology Standards,1,,2018-10-19 19:00:59 UTC,2018-10-19 19:00:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Paul Rothi</em></p>
<p>In August, BTS completed work with HR to include several ADA assistive technologies in the BTS Standards Directory. Lead by Christian Zenzano, he and Erin Poole from BTS, and Anais Keenon from BHR worked over the summer to identify commonly used assistive technologies. The list was evaluated, and the most common products were recommended for inclusion in the BTS Standards Directory based on conversations with external agencies such as Oregon Commission for the Blind, and an internal look at products already in use within the City&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p>
<p>This work directly supports several initiatives in the OMF Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>Adopt 21<sup>st</sup> Century Business Solutions by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce administrative workload on bureaus, with a specific focus on streamlining business processes.</li>
<li>Adopt new shared technology platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Develop an inclusive talented workforce by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support Employer of Choice initiatives to attract, develop and retain the best employees.</li>
<li>Strengthen onboarding for City employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to this work, most assistive technologies went through the BTS exception process adding time to the onboarding process. Inclusion in the Standards Directory eliminates the need for an exception, standardizes common products, and streamlines getting the product to the employee. The result is a faster time to productivity for the employee!</p>
<p>The entries in the BTS Standards Directory have been identified with a red [ADA] tag throughout the document including the index. There is also an ADA index entry that lists all [ADA] tagged products. A link to the <a href=""/bts/article/44978"">BTS Standards Directory</a> can be found on the <a href=""/bts/46940"">BTS Technology Standards web page</a> at <a href=""/bts/46940"">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/46940</a>.</p>

BTS Blog,697828,Public Safety IT Division Rolls Out New Hardware for Police Mobile Display Computers,1,,2018-09-17 18:04:18 UTC,2018-09-14 19:35:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em><em>By Chad Lublin</em></em></p>
<p>Last year, we were tasked with replacing 376 aging mobile data computers (MDCs) for Police. At a cost of nearly $2 million dollars and with the help of a number of BTS and Police staff, this was no small undertaking. For the past 10 years, Police has used the same devices made by Panasonic. This time around, we decided to review the marketplace to determine whether a better product was available. With advice from local partner agencies, information gathered during an in-house vendor fair, reviews from the BTS hardware standards team and Public Safety Division IT staff, and three rounds of evaluation that included nearly 100 Police users, the team determined that in fact, a better product was available. Enter <a href=""https://us.getac.com/index.html"">Getac</a>.</p>

<p>The new Getac MDCs will be more user friendly, much faster, more ergonomically correct, include a clearer display and integrated ID card reader and driver&rsquo;s license reader (no more external devices), allow for easier removal from the car, less technically complex, and much easier to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>As of today all new equipment has been procured by BTS Stores, and the Radio Shop has begun deployment and has been trained on support processes.&nbsp;Twenty five police officers and sergeants have been trained to provide in-field support with their contact information provided in every patrol car, five user videos and nine user documents are available as a resource to officers, and a sustainment plan has been agreed upon by the BTS Call Center, Stores, Radio, and Public Safety Divisions; OMF Chief Administrative Office; the Police Chief&rsquo;s Office and Fiscal Services division; and three vendors.&nbsp; This includes hardware and software support processes, a life cycle replacement plan, and a financial administration and funding plan.</p>

<p>The project started nearly a year-and-a-half ago and is on schedule and below initial budget estimates by nearly $700,000 (mostly due to negotiations with our vendors). A big thanks to all who have contributed to the success of this project!</p>

<p><strong>Who are we? </strong></p>
<p>Team members Chris Cavanagh (currently on loan to the Portland Building Reconstruction Project), Ashish Gupta, Robert Kiningham, Liz Mitchell, Erin Poole, Elyse Rosenberg, and Mark Tanner come from a variety of backgrounds and experience including: IT support, IT management, project management, organizational change management, contracting and finance.&nbsp; <a href=""/bts/article/53999"">Each Technology Business Consultant (TBC) on the team is assigned to work with specific City Bureaus and Offices</a>.&nbsp; We develop a primary relationship with a liaison in each bureau, but also work with bureau leadership, management and staff.&nbsp; Together, we work to understand the business goals of our customers and connect them with technology solutions that help them achieve those goals.&nbsp; We also work with BTS teams to design new services to meet customer demand and improve our current services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we do this?&nbsp; Through Trust and Relationships.&nbsp; We are committed both to the success of our customers and of BTS.&nbsp; That can only happen through developing long-term relationships that allow for honest communication, clear expectations, and keeping our own commitments as well as helping BTS keep our collective commitments.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Yeah, but what do you actually do?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Here are a few recent examples of what we do and how we work to move City and BTS business forward&hellip;</p>
<ul>

<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">The call for organizations to focus on diversity is stronger than ever. Research shows that teams with diverse perspectives produce higher-quality work than more homogenous teams. Even more research shows that companies whose leadership contains a higher proportion of women enjoy higher financial numbers than those with a lower proportion.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">All the arrows point to the notion that more diversity in an organization will reap more success. But a question that must be asked is this: What is the reality?</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">A study performed by Catalyst, a non-profit organization focused on creating inclusive workplaces for women, unpacks this question with a term called ""emotional tax"", which is defined as ""the heightened experience of being different from peers at work because of your gender and/or race/ethnicity and the associated detrimental effects on health, well-being, and the ability to thrive at work."" </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">Given this study on emotional tax, the question being asked must then be refined to: What is the reality for women of color, where this intersection of race and gender meet? (Note: I must preface that I recognize there are so many more intersections of race and gender other than that of a cis woman of color&rsquo;s, especially intersections experienced by those belonging to the LGBTQIA community. I am focusing on this particular intersection in this article because I identify as a cis woman of color; therefore, this is the only intersection I can speak to from personal experience.)</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""> The implications of the ""emotional tax"" for women of color in the workplace are staggeringly multi-faceted and dynamic in nature, as women of color are forced to navigate the interplaying forces of race and gender in the workplace, while grappling with instances of microaggressions; being stereotyped; and being tokenized. While these challenges in and of themselves are already heavy to bear, women of color do so while being expected to maintain their current level of job performance; any plans of excelling and pursuing opportunities for advancement require even more work. I interpret this phenomenon to be something called ""emotional labor"".</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""> ""Emotional labor"" is a term coined by the sociologist Arlie Hochschild to describe the hidden emotional work service industry workers are expected to perform to positively influence the experience of a customer or colleague. In other words, the service worker must constantly manage their emotions&mdash;either by suppressing them, showing them, or redefining them&mdash;to achieve the results they want and to get the job done. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">While emotional labor often makes its appearance in contemporary culture as something women&mdash;and not men&mdash;are expected to do in their work and personal lives, I feel it has weightier ramifications for women of color. A common narrative I often hear, and can relate to, when other women of color share their workplace experiences, is that these challenges they face every day, mentioned above&mdash;racism, sexism, stereotypes, microaggressions, tokenism, etc.&mdash;add to their plate, to the effect that it feels like they have to work two times, three times, </span></span><em><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">ten </span></span></em><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">times as hard as white and/or male counterparts in order to prove that they are competent, knowledgeable, and deserve a seat at the table.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=685679"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""385"" /></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""> I work as a Business Systems Analyst for the City of Portland. On a personal level, I find my work stimulating and rewarding. But as a young woman of color in the workplace, my job is not without obstacles.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""> Every day, I perform copious and continuous amounts of emotional labor. I am so accustomed to switching context and tailoring my identity and the language I use to make other people comfortable. I interact with customers and colleagues alike in a premeditated regimen of behavior, designed over the years to elicit a maximally favorable response from those I interact with. If this approach seems a tad too cautious or calculated, trust me&mdash;I really would have preferred to walk in the world differently. Whether they are customers, co-workers, or higher-rank colleagues, most interactions for me will require a high degree of internal emotional regulation. As I am constantly performing this emotional labor where everybody is a ""customer"", there are few people I can be my authentic self with.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">I am a young Filipino woman who was not born in the United States. I was the first one in my family to attend an American college. My mother was summa cum laude of her class in the Philippines. My family came here to carve out better lives for ourselves. I felt I needed to do well: to represent my family, make my mother proud, and adjust to this new environment.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">Needless to say, I was feeling a little bit of pressure.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">As a first-generation immigrant, my reality is that I am not from here. I experience subtle reminders every day that I am not from here, whether it&rsquo;s the small talk I have a hard time initiating; or my complete lack of familiarity with the area; or the silent question in people&rsquo;s eyes that asks ""what are you?"" or ""how did <em><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">you </span></span></em><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">get here?"" </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">I was raised to work hard, yet stay quiet. It is a daily fight to find my own voice amongst others. I am bicultural, having grown up speaking English and having spent my teenage years in Canada. I recognize that this has granted me many advantages that others who arrived here as adults do not have. However, sometimes I feel like the two sides of my identity&mdash;the Filipino side, the values I was raised with, and the North American side, the drive to be a leader, to be bolder, to speak louder&mdash;are waging war: at the cost of being successful at work, and fitting into this white culture, should I compromise my heritage, authenticity, and identity? Sometimes it is difficult to find that balance. Sometimes, in the workplace, I doubt myself because of this.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">Every day, as I collaborate, facilitate, initiate, and all other forms of -ate, I struggle to assimilate into an institution that is predominantly white and is too afraid, too uncomfortable, to talk about race and gender. By ignoring my reality, my workplace is effectively erasing my experience and silencing my voice. At the end of my day, this ""hidden"" labor, more often than not, manifests in a mental and physical exhaustion.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">This tendency to avert the subjects of race and gender is harmful to women of color, as it threatens to blanket our unique experiences under the idea of ""meritocracy"", a system that serves to advance individuals purely on their ability and effort &mdash; the familiar adage of ""I don&rsquo;t see color or gender, I only see ability"" may come into mind. This gender and color-invisible stance may have been intended to help under the guise of ""equality""&mdash;a one-size-fits-all notion&mdash;but it is causing more harm than good, especially when played out at the institutional level. By giving everyone the same treatment, and ignoring the nuanced identities of its workforce, an organization is only sabotaging itself and perpetuating a system of inequity. Emotional tax is paid not just by the employees in an organization, but by the organization itself.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">I know this is a lot to take in. I know it might feel uncomfortable. But there is a way this can turn around, and at the risk of sounding like a clich&eacute;, it starts with you. Be an ally. For me, an ally would be someone who does self-reflection on the way that <em><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">they </span></span></em><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">walk in the world and how that differs from the way that </span></span><em><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">I </span></span></em><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">walk in the world. They would recognize that these differences may signify that they have privilege in ways that I, as a woman of color, do not. They would listen, get to know me as a person, and recognize that my identity and unique experiences influence my approach to work. They would take the steps to educate themselves without burdening me. They would lean into the discomfort they feel. They would use their privilege to stand up for me and uplift me. Eventually, for my sake, they would feel threads of the same pain that I do. And in them empathizing with and validating my reality, I would feel less of a need to perform emotional labor around them, and be my authentic self more.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;""><span style=""; font-size: medium;"">Imagine the positive changes that could ripple through a workplace if genuine allyship such as this was practiced at the organizational level&mdash;to the extent that women of color feel included, supported, and valued. Imagine the rewards an organization could reap from fostering a work culture that truly embraces diversity and the enriching perspectives that come with it. Imagine if women of color felt like they could be their authentic selves at work, unhindered by the daily task of survival. Imagine instead, if such strength and resilience were unleashed to thrive. This is the kind of organization I would want to work for, and give my all for. This would be the reality that I strive for: a reality that recognizes mine.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

BTS Blog,684303,Spotlight - Enterprise Architecture:  Don't Build Your Building Without Plans,1,,2018-05-14 21:37:57 UTC,2018-05-14 20:01:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Paul Rothi</em></p>
<p>Would you build a building without a set of plans showing how the building is supposed to be built? It is through architecture that the building is designed and constructed so the finished product aligns with the business needs and code requirements, and all of the internal systems work and fit together. Architecture plays a similar role in the design and implementation of complex software systems, the planning and coordination of multiple systems across and enterprise, or in planning how the enterprise will respond to technology or business disruptions.</p>
<p>The Architecture is developed in four principle layers &ndash; business, information, application and technology &ndash; typically in that order. As in the design of a building, the architecture work first identifies what the end result &ndash; &nbsp;the Future State &ndash; &nbsp;is envisioned to look like.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Business Architecture</strong> focuses on the business outcomes from a business perspective. Business architecture documents how customers, partners and staff interact with the system through the key activities, resources, costs and revenue streams. Capabilities and requirements are then aligned with the desired future business outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Information Architecture</strong> focuses on what information is needed to be successful, who needs it, when and where.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application Architecture</strong> examines how the application or system is designed. It also defines how multiple applications work together to deliver the necessary information to those that need it, to fulfill the business outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, <strong>Technical Architecture</strong> focuses on how the physical infrastructure fits together based on the requirements of the applications, and the City&rsquo;s established infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Information Security and other compliance requirements are considered in every aspect of the architecture work.</p>
<p>Architecture is leveraged to reduce risk. By having a good set of plans, there is a better chance of &ldquo;building&rdquo; right the first time. Having a complete picture up front can also facilitate the planning of a series of releases where additional functionality is implemented as a logical progression.</p>
<p>Here are some of the projects and ongoing activities the EA team has recently or is currently engaged in.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continually monitor the Windows 10 and Office 365 feature changes: &nbsp;The team tracks changes that will likely affect the City&rsquo;s use of the operating system or Office suite. Depending on the changes, these can be quite disruptive to City operations. As potentially disruptive features and changes are detected, BTS operational areas most likely to be affected are informed so response plans can be formed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>POPS Architecture. The Portland Online Permitting System (POPS) is not a single application, but multiple applications within BDS that interface with 10&rsquo;s of applications both internal and external to the City. The EA team has worked to document and help all bureaus involved understand a business view into the complexity of this undertaking. Below is a diagrammatic tool called a Business Model Canvas that illustrates the complexity of the POPS landscape from a business point of view. Every box within the canvas represents an aspect of the business of permits that must be thought about and addressed by the new POPS system. While not indicated on this version of the canvas, some boxes represent future functionality that will not exist in the initial roll-out. At the technical end, the team is providing high level documentation about the technical architecture which in turn informs where more detailed documentation is needed about systems or interfaces.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>(click on image for full size version)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Microsoft Licensing and Features: Working with several BTS Divisions, EA dug deeply into the feature and licensing structure of Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows 10 operating system, Office 365 and a new product offering called Microsoft 365. The purpose was to understand and make recommendations for expanded licensing that aligned with City business needs. This work directly supported the creation of the 2018-19 budget add package for the Enterprise Mobility and Security suite addition to Office 365.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital / Electronic Signature service design: The team again worked with BTS customers to identify business needs for digital / electronic signatures. The result of the work formed the basis for a 2018-19 budget package to add this service to the BTS portfolio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Portland Building Future Technology: The team is working with the TPB project team and consultants to help insure the building is positioned to leverage 21<sup>st</sup> century technology when the building is re-occupied sometime in 2020, and flexible enough to accommodate the evolution of technology into the future. This includes technologies in the conference and meeting rooms, building access, printer management, and digital signage. We continually ask questions about the expected technology experience in the building, and work as needed to align and integrate technology platforms to achieve the expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>

BTS Blog,679128,Spotlight - SET: BTS Systems Engineering Team Marks One Year Anniversary,1,,2018-04-04 17:46:16 UTC,2018-04-04 17:39:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=679127"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""375"" /><em></em></em></p>
<p><em>By Lisa Bigley<em></em></em></p>
<p>When the Systems Engineering Team (SET) was formed last year, it was pointed out to me that SET is the name of the Egyptian god of war, chaos and storms. I wondered at the time if that would be an appropriate description for this new team and its inherited responsibilities!</p>
<p>March 6th marked the one-year anniversary of the formation of the SE Team. We celebrated our survival of the year with pizza and took a few minutes to look back on our first year together.</p>
<h1>In the beginning</h1>
<p><strong>SE Team Vision</strong>: Encouraging teamwork, innovation and automation resulting in division-wide process improvement and enhanced customer service. (It&rsquo;s a lofty vision but the team willingly embraced the challenge).</p>
<p><strong>Goal for the year:</strong> Our goal for the year was to successfully transition from our previous teams and form a functioning new team together. We all knew each other and some of us had worked together on other teams, but now we needed to learn how to work together on this new team. And though the systems and processes we are responsible for aren&rsquo;t new to the city, they were new to most of the people on the team, so we had to work together to cross-train and get up-to-speed as quickly as possible to support our customers.</p>
<h1>Who are we?</h1>
<p>The team drew its initial members from different technological disciplines across BTS. Each of them brought perspective and experience derived from their work with our other great teams. If you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to meet them yet, stop by the 1900 building and say hello.</p>
<p><strong>Team Members: </strong>James Abudakar, Tony DeFrancesco, Cory Malain, Troy Lambert, Garrett Holyk, Rick Gresham, and Matt Carson</p>
<h1>What do we do?</h1>
<p>The SE Team manages, maintains and supports the systems that the Support Center uses to do its work, including Altiris, Cherwell, Bomgar, McAfee, AD Manager, OneDrive for Business and Cyberark. We also provide many services for BTS and customers. Here are some of the highlights:</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Security: </strong>The SE Team is responsible for city-wide patching and maintains the McAfee Antivirus system. This year, the team researched, planned and implemented a new patching strategy (Power-on-Wednesday) and refined processes around patching and upgrading Windows 10 computers.</p>
<p><strong>Software Deployments &amp; Configurations: </strong>We script installations and deploy software for customers who need applications to be installed on a large number of computers. This year, we deployed 19 software packages and updated several others. We also handle GPO Administration for desktop computers and as part of that work, we met with Microsoft and other BTS teams to review the overall health of our group policies. The Group Policy Committee is using the feedback from this session to improve our GPO structure and practices.</p>
<p><strong>Cherwell Design and Management:</strong> We manage the Cherwell ticketing system and do design and development work for this system. Some of our recent efforts include: creating a new Appointment module that will be used for customers to schedule phone appointments with the Call Center, design improvements to the knowledge base module, and creating workflows to automated some of our processes.&nbsp; We also provide consulting services for custom dashboards, reports, and searches. This year we&rsquo;ll be focusing on redesigning the Customer Portal.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 10 Program: </strong>Every 6 months, a new version of Windows 10 emerges and the city needs to review the new release, update the bureau&rsquo;s application catalogs, visit each Windows 10 bureau to talk with them about testing their critical applications, review the new security baseline, and test and deploy the new OS version and security baseline settings. The team manages this process for each product lifecycle. We upgraded two versions of Windows 10 in the last year.</p>
<p><strong>Altiris Administration: </strong>Altiris is used for a lot of the processes in Support Center. Part of the work the SE Team does with this tool (on top of application upgrades, patch management, software delivery, etc) is managing agent health, creating reports, managing software licensing, and providing support for the asset management work done by other teams. This year, the team built a new Altiris server and migrated information from the old server to the new one. Because of this work, we&rsquo;re seeing improvements in Altiris agent health, which improves our ability to successfully install software and patches on city computers and improves our asset inventory information as well.<strong></strong></p>
<h1>What&rsquo;s next?</h1>
<p>The team survived its first year without too many wars, a moderate amount of chaos, and only an occasional storm. During our first annual team meeting earlier this month, we turned our attention to what we can do to maintain and improve our contribution in the coming year. Here are some of items we came up with.</p>
<p>We want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be easy to work with and always willing to help</li>
<li>Do excellent work and provide reliable solutions that made other&rsquo;s jobs easier</li>
<li>Provide great customer service</li>
<li>Complete work for our customers quickly</li>
<li>Introduce a new era of automation for the city</li>
</ul>
<p>This coming year, the SE team hopes to live up to some of these aspirations or at least make progress! We plan to continue our cross-training efforts and endeavor to be better this year than we were last year.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/679128

BTS Blog,676400,SuperStar Award Presented to Dee Griffin,1,,2018-03-14 18:25:13 UTC,2018-03-12 23:11:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=676590"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""375"" /></em></p>

<p>Dee is contagiously positive whenever I see her or hear her voice. Every single day, to everyone around her, you can hear the upbeat way in which she not only carries herself, but also brings everyone up with her positivity and laughter. Conversations with Dee always leaves both a smile and a happy outlook that carries for a long time afterward. &ldquo;We&rdquo; as in BTS and the City are fortunate to have such a positive force among us.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/676400
BTS Blog,676330,Brookwood Data Center Set To Expand,1,,2018-03-12 19:11:52 UTC,2018-03-12 17:18:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Dave Berg<em><em></em></em></em></p>
<p>Many of you can remember the recent project that involved moving our data center out of the Portland Building and into a collocation facility in Hillsboro Oregon. BTS reviewed many different facilities and options when selecting the home of our future data center, and ultimately landed some space in the Brookwood facility owned by ViaWest, which is now called &ldquo;Flexential&rdquo;. The newer data center facility was roughly 105,000 square feet of open floor space; dedicated to hosting best in class data center power and cooling for their customers.</p>
<p>As the City moved into the new space, additional customers started to consume floor space as well, including two new submarine cables that would improve network connectivity on the west coast to other countries in the world &ndash; <a href=""https://www.viawest.com/knowledge-center/viawest-data-center-hillsboro-ore-offer-high-speed-low-latency-direct-network"">Cross Pacific</a> which connects from Hillsboro Oregon to Asia and <a href=""https://www.viawest.com/knowledge-center/hawaiki-cable-selects-peak-10-viawest-hillsboro-ore-data-center-us-point-presence"">Hawaiki</a> which connects Hillsboro to New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>The Brookwood data center is now going through a construction project to increase its available data center floor space from the original 105,000 square feet to an astonishing 220,000 square feet. To help identify the magnitude of the available data center floor space, the cage that houses the City data center equipment at Brookwood is 540 square feet. The additional space will be added to the North side of the facility, and will include increasing the power capability by an additional 18 Megawatts (MW), and increasing the cooling capacity to support an additional 148,000 square feet. The total power capacity for the entire facility will be 32 MW. That may not be enough power to send Doc and Marty into the future, but 32 MW is enough to power an estimated 32,000 homes! Once the new facility is constructed and ready for production use, access will be made between the older facility and new facility between the current exterior North wall. Flexential estimates the construction to be completed by August at the latest.</p>

<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=676332"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""202"" /></p>
<p>The demand for data center floor space within the Brookwood facility will increase the availability of resources such as network connectivity options, power and cooling redundancies, and backup power capabilities. The growth is exciting for our region, and shows the continued shift in IT to move away from data center facility management, and put the onus back on the companies that make it their business to provide these state of the art, reliable services.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/676330

BTS Blog,671579,Spotlight - eGov:  PDX Reporter Featured on KATU News at 6,1,,2018-02-06 23:46:04 UTC,2018-02-01 23:22:00 UTC,A,,"<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=671647"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""374.012638231"" /></p>
<p><em>By Greg Clapp</em></p>
<p>Portland television&nbsp;station&nbsp;KATU recently visited BTS to talk on camera&nbsp;about the new PDX Reporter web app and learn about the upcoming version 1.0 release. The segment was featured on <em>KATU News at 6</em>, on January 16, 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 12pt;""><a href=""http://katu.com/news/local/pdx-reporter-citys-web-app-for-reporting-neighborhood-problems-gets-an-upgrade"">PDX Reporter: City's web app for reporting neighborhood problems to get an upgrade</a><!--?xml:namespace prefix = ""o"" ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /--></span></p>
<p>During the interview, I chatted with KATU News reporter Stuart Tomlinson chatted about the history of the app, the upcoming release, and some of the more popular report types submitted by Portland residents. Tomlinson, a fan and frequent user of the app, commented off camera that he and his neighbors have had great success getting issues resolved through its use, and he wanted to bring more awareness of it&nbsp;to the public.</p>
<p>Originally launched in 2009 as a native iOS and Android app, the&nbsp;PDX Reporter web app beta version was publicly released in April,&nbsp;2017. The web app&nbsp;was developed by myself and Brittany Smart, and we continue to support and extend it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>&ldquo;It's a universal version that can basically be used on any device with a web browser phone, desktop, tablet,&rdquo; [Clapp]&nbsp;said. &ldquo;It gives us a lot more flexibility for creating, updating and doing bug fixes, adding new features.""</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>&ldquo;It's going to be dramatically improved over the beta -- we've learned a lot of lessons over the last eight months,&rdquo; said Gregg [sic] Clapp of Portland&rsquo;s Bureau of Technology Services.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The improved&nbsp;Version 1.0 is expected to hit in late February or early March, 2018. The initial&nbsp;beta was a hastily made prototype designed to mimic the functionality of the aging native phone apps and allow those apps to be retired. Completely rewritten as a true HTML5/AngularJS single page application, the new 1.0&nbsp;version will boast new features, a more usable interface, and the ability to support&nbsp;customized reporting forms.</p>

<p>Paul Hill with BTS Communications&nbsp;purchased a pair of Nikon D3300's (low end DSLRs) and also a couple of&nbsp;intervalometers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of those are&nbsp;designed to run on battery so he rigged up some battery replacers connected to AC adapters.&nbsp; He also found&nbsp;couple of uninterruptible power supplies to plug it all into.&nbsp; We&nbsp;put a 64 GB card in each and set the intervalometers to take one picture per hour.&nbsp; We set them up on the 11th floor of the Justice Center (BTS at PPB) and the 6th floor of the Congress Center (PBOT).</p>

<p>The one at Congress took some work to minimize the reflections &ndash; the double-pane glass with the wide angle is the culprit. &nbsp;Mostly this involved taping up some black paper and also cannibalizing an empty black 11 x 17 binder we found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are taking a picture once an hour.&nbsp; The SD cards are big enough take both a JPEG and a RAW image at the same time, for about 1300 shots, or about 56 days worth.&nbsp;We will plan on coming back once a month or so for the&nbsp;next three years&nbsp;to swap out the SD cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're not sure what the end products will look like but we're thinking both a series of still as well as videos could be derived from the photos.&nbsp; If you have any experience creating time lapse movies from still images, let us know.</p>

BTS Blog,670030,Spotlight -  Information Security:  Secrets of the Inner Sanctum Revealed,1,,2018-01-19 20:44:40 UTC,2018-01-19 20:40:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Christopher Paidhrin</em></p>
<p>A question Information Security team members get fairly often is, &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our team is tucked away behind a locked door labeled &ldquo;Inner Sanctum&rdquo; on the third floor of Columbia Square. This is a name we did not choose for ourselves. Our preference would be to work in a shared security operations center, where Network Team, Server Team, Support teams and all operational security staff could share a common workspace. Instead, out of necessity, we toil away in an intense and fervent atmosphere, out of sight. What we do isn&rsquo;t much talked about because a fair portion of it is rightly confidential.</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=670028"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""281"" /></p>
<p><em>Pictured above:&nbsp; Not the real City of Portland InfoSec team.</em></p>
<p>While each team member has assigned scopes of work&mdash;and workbooks of tasks, outside of Cherwell tickets&mdash;there is a fair amount of cross-training and support. Our focus is on our core service catalog, which distills into a small number of security-related services: Governance, which includes strategy, planning, policies, contracts, compliance and regulations; Security Architecture and Design, which includes standards, exceptions to Admin Rules, new technologies and projects; Risk Assessments, which help bureaus identify and remediate challenges in their workflows and environments; Incident Response, which includes forensics and analysis of a spectrum of detected threats and attacks; Awareness and Education, which includes CityLearner modules, Just In Time individual training, and bureau focused education sessions; and Monitoring and Alerting, which includes a collection of tools that watch for bad things happening across the City&rsquo;s diverse technology environments.</p>
<p>In addition to the ongoing scope of activities, the Information Security team is excited to engage many BTS and Citywide teams with our roster of security projects:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>GRC&nbsp;(Governance, Risk, and Compliance) Cherwell workflow module: Kick-off is this February with Support Center and Cherwell, with the goal to automate the City&rsquo;s compliance workflow. Think of all that the City does for PCI Compliance and imagine that a quarter of the work effort can be automated. The City has six compliance regimes, but we don&rsquo;t have six teams. The goal&nbsp;is to layer on, de-duplicate, and automate all compliance efforts to&nbsp;minimize the burden on everyone&rsquo;s time and effort.</li>
<li>Firewall Technology Refresh: The Network Team and Information Security are aligning&nbsp;to revision the City&rsquo;s core security model and platform. A lot has changed&nbsp;in the years since our last technology refresh. The diversity and scope of&nbsp;City services and requirements call for an evolution in security&nbsp;architecture. These are exciting times!</li>
<li>Identity&nbsp;Security Initiatives: Information Security is partnering with peer BTS&nbsp;teams to explore two-factor authentication, privileged access management,&nbsp;and related capabilities for remote and mobile access to City technology&nbsp;resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The City is abuzz with change, and each change of policy, technology contract, exception request, and security incident, all require some degree of attention from our team. Behind the Inner Sanctum door, there&rsquo;s a lot going on.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/670030

<p><em>By Adam Best</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with Lonnie for over a decade now and I finally have an open platform of which to express my gratitude. He has always been approachable with a great big smile on his face regardless of work load. He is always here. He is always reliable. There are those &lsquo;Go-To&rsquo; people you know that exist around your work flow. Sometimes directly and other times indirectly. There are those that go the extra mile. The ones you can count on for not only their own responsibilities but commonly outside of their scope of work. He is one of those individuals. It is reassuring knowing he is in my corner and ultimately an integral part helping me provide service to my customers within various City projects. I know I could not succeed without his involvement. Thank you, Lonnie for being my Super Star!</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/668298
BTS Blog,668154,Thank You City of Portland from Free Geek,1,,2018-01-16 21:21:44 UTC,2018-01-05 21:01:00 UTC,A,,"<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/UP4jhn2x5C4?rel=0"" width=""560""></iframe></p>
<p>The City of Portland has had a symbiotic relationship with <a href=""https://www.freegeek.org/"">Free Geek</a> for over a decade.</p>
<p>Free Geek&rsquo;s mission is to sustainably reuse technology, enable digital access, and provide education to create a community that empowers people to realize their potential.&nbsp; This fits easily into the City&rsquo;s overall sustainability, recycling and community development goals and desires.&nbsp; Over the course of the last decade plus, the City has provided Free Geek with thousands of computers which have been used to educate citizens and provide technology to community organizations, schools, non-profits and individuals.</p>
<p>Free Geek's Hardware Grants program provides computer hardware to nonprofit organizations that are in need of new or upgraded technology and do not have the resources to acquire that technology. The incoming stream of used City of Portland computers allowed them to fill grant requests from Portland nonprofit organizations. Hardware Grants to organizations such as VOZ Worker&rsquo;s Rights, Community Cycling Center, Write Around Portland, Sierra Club, Saturday Academy, Charles Jordan Community Center, Artists Repertory Theatre, Mercy Corps NW, and the Urban League of Portland, just to name just a few.</p>
<p>In 2010, Free Geek's program Plug Into Portland was created to specifically target students in the Portland Public School system and provide refurbished computer systems to any K12 student that had completed 24 hours of volunteer service in their communities. Over the years the program has gained recognition as they reach out to various schools, parents, and administrators.&nbsp; During one six-month reporting period, students volunteered over 1,440 hours of time in their community.&nbsp; Free Geek approved 60 applications and disbursed computers to those students serving their community. With each computer they gave away they had each student/family attended a digital literacy class where they taught them how to use the systems effectively.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a conduit for refurbishing computers and supporting community based organizations in the Portland Metropolitan area; Free Geek performs the, underappreciated, service of providing a sustainable and environmentally friendly recycling resource for the City&rsquo;s old, broken and reusable Electronic equipment and media.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/668154

BTS Blog,662792,BTS Team Highlights – Corporate GIS,1,,2017-11-17 00:15:32 UTC,2017-11-08 23:34:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Matt Freid</em></p>
<p>The mission of our team is help customers put the &lsquo;Where&rsquo; in their data and applications.&nbsp; GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems and at its core is a technology that allows you to find spatial relationships between otherwise unrelated datasets and create applications that utilize location.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you use Google maps or the GPS in your car you are tapping into the power of GIS and we work to make this type of functionality available across our enterprise.</p>
<p>Our program has been around for almost 20 years now but we still do our best to add new tools that developers and customers can use to meet emerging needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with supporting over 1200 GIS desktops installs and publishing 1500 datasets provided by almost every city bureau we have been building out our web based systems to increase access for more employees and citizens.&nbsp; We work with GIS staff in the bureaus, the Vertical Applications team and rely on Production Services, Networking, Communications and many other groups in BTS to make these projects successful.&nbsp; Here are a few ways that we have been employing web GIS with our existing systems over the last year.</p>
<p><strong>Snow Plow Locations and Real Time Data &ndash;</strong> One of the most interesting and challenging projects we have been involved in this year is a collaboration with PBOT and Vertical Applications to produce a public facing web map showing the locations of snow removal vehicles in real time.&nbsp; Remember the challenges of getting around the city last winter in all the snow and ice?&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of that experience came a desire to show what the city was doing to respond not after the fact but during the event to help citizens see where work was being done in as close to real time as possible.&nbsp; This challenge helped us create a GIS implementation utilizing data from Internet of Things devices in a transportation project, demonstrating how the BTS can get involved in efforts like Smart Cities and supporting autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>The first step was getting data from the vehicles.&nbsp; Michael McDonald with Vertical Applications worked with the vendor that provides the GPS units in all PBOT trucks to create a process that constantly queries a data endpoint to get location and operational data once a minute.&nbsp; This data is then made available through a web socket that our systems can pick up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Working with PBOT staff, Mike Quetel, Ryan Chen and Kellie Hauger on our team added a new piece of GIS software called GeoEvent Server that consumes data from this source and provides it to a web page that refreshes as the data changes, showing the snow plows moving around as they clear the streets.&nbsp; There were many challenges in automating and visualizing this data in the way that the customer wanted it to be communicated, but the product is ready for use on your desktop or mobile device before the first snowflakes of the season fall.&nbsp; Look for PBOT to promote it to the public the next time there is a threat of winter weather.&nbsp; <em>Update 11/16/17 -- the plow map is now live, <a title=""GET HOME SAFE: Winter Weather Center"" href=""http://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=935da87d18d148d784d164adcb7218df"">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=662788"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""351"" /></p>
<p><strong>Fiber Route Mapping &ndash;</strong> Sometimes we get the opportunity to get involved in a project where BTS itself is customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is setting up a web application that allows BTS staff to GIS edit data in the field, making it easier for subject matter experts collect data and share easily share it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fire Bureau and BTS Communications were looking for a way to create a map showing where an existing coax cable system is located and use it to see where future infrastructure could be placed once it is retired over the next few years.&nbsp; Previously field notes were translated into a digital version back in the office which made the process slower and potentially less accurate.&nbsp; CGIS team members Paul Cone, Kellie Hauger and Mitch Vanderperren created an editable web mapping service on our infrastructure that can be updated on an iPad using just a web browser.&nbsp; This data is also shared out to other agencies like Tri-Met directly so they can see changes instantly and then work with the city to design fiber routes to reach new customers and improve network performance for city staff.&nbsp; In the future in could be incorporated into projects like the one CGIS team member Tammy Dong has been working on with the Communications Division to plan how the city&rsquo;s fiber program can grow over time.</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=662790"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""266"" /></p>
<p>You can see&nbsp;the interactive map&nbsp;at <a href=""http://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=9d72004f356147fdb7e8aafd70e7faf1"">http://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=9d72004f356147fdb7e8aafd70e7faf1 </a></p>
<p><strong>ArcGIS for Enterprise &ndash; </strong>One of the newest web GIS platforms we have been working with is <a href=""http://www.esri.com/en/arcgis/products/arcgis-enterprise/overview"">ArcGIS for Enterprise</a>, which has promise to offer some interesting new use cases for browser based mapping applications in the City.&nbsp; The previous examples use the ArcGIS Online platform to create web maps and applications &ndash; it is the cloud based content management system provided by our main GIS software vendor ESRI.&nbsp; ArcGIS Online is great for sharing content with the public and works well with data on our servers, hosted data as well as web mapping services shared by other agencies while ArcGIS for Enterprise is an on-premise version of this same system that adds additional functionality.&nbsp; A key use case it provides is sharing content easily with people in our organization only &ndash; on ArcGIS IOnline this requires managing an identity to distinguish a subset of city staff from the public.&nbsp; CGIS team members Aaron Kilbey and Trevor Smith have been working with Production Services to integrate ArcGIS for Enterprise into the city network, allow supporting sharing of internal content like engineering schematics or workgroups collaborating on draft applications before they widely published.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since ArcGIS for Enterprise utilizes a web architecture, users can also access content on mobile devices much like they do with Office 365, making it easy to use these applications anytime from anywhere.</p>
<p>We are excited about the new ways that GIS is being used by BTS and the bureaus.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are interested in learning more about how to use GIS and apply it to what you do, please let us know.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/662792
BTS Blog,662699,New Phone System for 911 Calls Goes Live at BOEC,1,,2017-11-08 22:52:02 UTC,2017-11-08 22:21:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Paul Cone</em></p>
<p>In Portland and Multnomah County, Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC) is the conduit through which most emergency service-request information flows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new phone system went live starting at 12:01 this past&nbsp;Tuesday at BOEC.&nbsp; Working alongside teams from Airbus (yes, the same company that makes jets also makes systems for 9-1-1 centers) and CenturyLink, staff from BOEC and BTS worked to set up both the new hardware and software for the new <a href=""http://airbus-dscomm.com/solutions/vesta-solutions.php"">VESTA 9-1-1 system</a>.&nbsp; VESTA brings a host of new technology to the BOEC call floor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately $2.5M of State 9-1-1 funding is being allocated to the upgrade.</li>
<li>This upgrade requires collaboration between Airbus, ECATs, CenturyLink, and Goserco, along with the Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC) and the Bureau of Technology Services (BTS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>New Vesta 9-1-1 VOIP emergency phone system with Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) functionality.</li>
<li>Replacing 50 Vesta call taking/dispatch work stations to move from Windows XP to Windows 10.</li>

BTS Blog,658900,BTS Employees Playing Cricket,1,,2017-10-12 20:21:28 UTC,2017-10-12 20:10:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Thang Ngo</em></p>
<p>Cricket&nbsp;is a bat-and-ball&nbsp;game&nbsp;played between two teams of eleven players each on a&nbsp;cricket&nbsp;field, at the center of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch with a target called the wicket (a set of three wooden stumps topped by two bails) at each end (source Wikipedia).</p>
<p>Do you know that cricket rank #2 as the most popular sport around the world? It&rsquo;s ranked second only after soccer. A group of BTS employees has been forming friendly pickup games, after work, to learn more about this sport. Even they&rsquo;re friendly competitions, trophy is presented to the winners of each game. So far, this group has played two games. The first game took place last fall between EBS and Vertical Applications at Duniway Park. The Vertical Applications team took home the trophy.</p>

<p>The EBS team wanted to take on a new challenge and played against a new team consisted of players from multiple teams: Network, Servers, PMO, and Customer Relations. EBS could not take on power of the multi-team combination, and the trophy goes to Mike Lamb to represent players on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor of the Columbia Building.</p>
<p>Regardless of teams, everyone had a great time.</p>

<p>Figure 1: Patricia Barrera, Molly Daul, Susan Lehman, and Ed Arib at SAKI conference in Washington DC</p>
<p>SAMS is a web application developed by the Portland Police Bureau ITD division for the sex crimes unit. Its purpose is to track every aspect of the sexual assault kit from collection to property room storage, forensic lab testing, and DNA results from the FBI CODIS system (Combined DNA Index System).&nbsp; The goal is to identify offenders and provide the information needed for prosecution. &nbsp;SAMS also tracks detailed information about the police case, suspect, victim, trafficker and different type of evidence.&nbsp; It is also used by Portland Police embedded victim advocates to document all their interaction with sex crime victims. SAMS is also used to fulfill the reporting requirements for the SAKI (Sexual Assault Kit Initiative) grant and the DANY (District Attorney of New York) grant.</p>
<p>SAMS was presented at the following national conferences: SAKI National Meeting in Washington, DC, and Detroit SAK Summit in Detroit, MI and was recognized as the first application available dedicated to tracking sexual assault cases and the collection and testing of sexual assault kits.&nbsp; Portland Police decided to share this application with any Police Department at no cost.</p>
<p>The success of SAMS generated a lot of interest from a number of police departments nationwide that don&rsquo;t have any complete solution for managing sexual assault kits.&nbsp; In order to continue developing and enhancing SAMS with more advanced features that would not only help the Portland Police Bureau but could also benefit a large number of police departments nationally, PPB applied for and obtained a one million dollar federal grant.&nbsp; This new grant will be used to enhance SAMS by adding bar code tracking, kit testing prioritization, advanced search functionality, business intelligence, and a mobile application for SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) nurses to use for their forensic exam.</p>
<p>On October 2<sup>nd</sup> through 4<sup>th</sup>, the City of Portland&rsquo;s Police Bureau held the annual Summit of Cities SAKI conference at the Portland Convention Center.&nbsp; This conference was organized by Molly Daul and Susan Lehman of the Portland Police Bureau. Portland was chosen as the site for the 2017 conference because of our work on SAMS (Sexual Assault Management System).</p>
<p>You can see the photo below, the kick-off of the conference with the Police Honor Guard, along with Mayor Ted Wheeler, Police Chief Danielle Outlaw, Multnomah County District Attorney Rod Underhill, and Commander Dave Hendrie.</p>

<p>Additionally, Ed Arib (seen in the photo below) and Susan Lehman presented the latest version of the SAMS system at the conference. Ed and Susan have been the brains behind the creation of this system. SAMS is being used in multiple jurisdictions across the country to manage sexual assault kits.</p>

BTS Blog,656934,Spotlight - Network and Telecom,1,,2017-09-28 13:37:39 UTC,2017-09-28 00:08:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Dave Berg</em></p>
<p><strong>BTS Team Highlights &ndash; Network and Telecom</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure all the BTS family can agree that the last few months have been extremely busy. The time is flying by. It feels like yesterday was June and tomorrow will be January. I&rsquo;ve submitted an RFP for a pause button, but I&rsquo;m not sure it will come through in time. &#9786;</p>
<p>Over the last couple of months, the Network and Telecom team have focused primarily on the Data Center Move, Portland Building renovation and move out, VoIP deployment, and DWDM installation, all while maintaining our current environment, combating phishing, other cyber security issues, and supporting our customer&rsquo;s operational needs. It&rsquo;s been stressful, but the team has kept their spirits high and have accomplished a mountain of work while also building trust within the team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few recent highlights for the team:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Center Move &ndash;</strong> Jeremy Boyd has done an outstanding job with designing and building a resilient network with a 40 Gig backbone that connects systems and services together in our new colocation space. This has not been an easy task, but Jeremy continues to drive the project forward. The new data center network fabric is installed and connected between Brookwood, Comm Center and TPB. Thanks to the work of Rebecca Huston, Jeff Yentz, Matt Cowan, and Kirksey Neumeyer, DWDM has been deployed to support multiple channels dedicated to the data center traffic. The 10 Gig ring is up and functional at Brookwood, and we even moved our SSL VPN appliances and one of the firewall clusters to Brookwood!</p>
<p>For those who have not been to the new colocation facility, here is a great virtual tour video:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.viawest.com/knowledge-center/videos/viawest-brookwood-data-center-virtual-tour"">https://www.viawest.com/knowledge-center/videos/viawest-brookwood-data-center-virtual-tour</a></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Avaya VoIP migrations &ndash; </strong>The drive for the City to retire the old, analog infrastructure continues. The Telecom team has done an amazing job with these VoIP migrations! Over the last 9 months, the Telecom team has replaced around 1,450 phones within the City, which brings our total Avaya user count to around 1,950 total users. The goal is to restart the migrations after the TPB moves are complete. The result will be a new Avaya version 7 platform and a total of around 5,000 users by early 2018. One of the highlights for the Avaya version 7 design includes system redundancy between facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=656932"" alt=""Phone Support System Map"" width=""500"" height=""239.547038328"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TPB Renovation and temp office spaces &ndash;</strong> Matt Cavaness has done an excellent job designing and connecting the three new temporary office locations that support the City employees. Kirksey Neumeyer has been focusing on building out each of the new office spaces for network connectivity (see the beautiful cabling job by Kirksey in the image below). At this point, we have completed four weekends of moves, which include: installing 27 switches and 43 wireless access points, moving 504 VoIP phones and 28 printers. Just under 500 people have moved out of TPB and into Columbia Square and 400 SW 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=656931"" alt=""Network Switch"" width=""500"" height=""447.907771136"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiber support &ndash; </strong>Rob Durkin manages our outside plant and fiber infrastructure. Recently, we had an issue where a leg of our 10 Gig ring and DWDM fiber was burnt, which required immediate repair. Rob partnered with Rebecca Huston on the 10 Gig ring side to restore the service. We dispatched one of our fiber repair companies on short notice, and they worked from around 6:00 PM until after 1:00 AM to restore service. It was a long night, but we are glad to have our fiber back! Below is an image of the work starting.</p>
<p><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=656929"" alt=""Fiber Maintenance Truck"" width=""500"" height=""375.174825175"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wireless growth &ndash; </strong>In July and August, Janelle Bentley and Pavel Probasco processed 385 wireless devices and resolved over 500 Cherwell tickets! It is amazing how the wireless world of cell phones and tablets continues to grow within the City. The announcement recently came out from Apple about the new iOS 11 and Apple suite of devices. The MTRC will be reviewing these new devices and iOS features in the coming weeks, and they will determine which devices we will adopt for our standards, and when we should upgrade to the new iOS version.&nbsp;</p>

He has worked with the Police Bureau IT staff to troubleshoot in-car computer issues, set up license plate reader cars, source new hardware as vendors change designs, and generally help the Police Bureau IT staff support our Police Bureau members in their day to day duties. His adaptability when it comes to configuring new systems or rolling out new hardware while working with PPB support hand in hand is spectacular. His knowledge of Police Bureau vehicles makes him a go to person when issues/questions arise, not only fixing problems but making sure PPB support staff understand what transpired. Adam always seems to be working at 110% and making everything look easy with a smile, even when working with a multitude of systems that require rapid responses.

<p>On behalf of the LMC we would like to thank all of you that participated in the 2017 Speed of Trust Survey.&nbsp; We appreciates everyone&rsquo;s candor and constructive feedback on how we can improve trust in BTS. &nbsp;We were thrilled that we had more than 150 participants in this year&rsquo;s survey. &nbsp;The LMC and our Leadership team take this feedback very seriously.&nbsp; It has been a two year journey to bring us where we are today.&nbsp; While we know we have a long ways to go to become a high trust environment, the survey results reflect that many of you believe we have made some progress as an organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you review the results you will see that in many areas our organization has made improvements in the 13 High Trust Behaviors.&nbsp; Most notably the results tell us that we are assuming more positive intent in our interactions with co-workers and are also more reflective on our own capabilities and behaviors as individuals. While the LMC is pleased with this progress we also know that we can do better and are invested in continuing to practice the high trust behaviors and grow them into our BTS culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also want to thank the 80 or so of you that showed up to the in person presentation of the results.&nbsp; You all provided feedback on suggested next steps to continue to improve trust for BTS.&nbsp;&nbsp; We did tell you that we would release the entire survey results with all of the comments in un-redacted form.&nbsp; The link below will take you to the survey the results.&nbsp; Again, we want to thank you for your honest feedback and we will use this feedback to work towards a higher trust workplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A number of you have asked if and when will we be doing a strategic plan. The answer is yes, we will be doing one, but we won&rsquo;t start working on it until 2018. With the numerous activities surrounding the Portland Building moves and the Data Center relocation project, I wanted to wait until these were done before working on our next strategic plan. Plus, as many of you know, Tom Rinehart is currently leading an effort to develop the OMF 2017-20 Strategic Plan and we need to make sure we are in alignment with the OMF plan. More to come on this topic in 2018.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/652624

BTS Blog,647766,An Update from the Director,1,,2017-07-20 17:07:27 UTC,2017-07-20 17:05:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Jeff Baer</em></p>
<p>BTS Employees,</p>
<p><strong>Moving Day</strong> - It&rsquo;s hard to believe that in less than a month (August 18<sup>th</sup>!) we will be the first bureau moving out of the Portland Building to our temporary location. Being the first ones out means we get to pave the way for the other bureaus as they start to migrate out of TPB and into their temporary locations. There will no doubt be some challenges to overcome, but I&rsquo;m confident we will figure it out and make the necessary adjustments. This will be a significant organizational and cultural change in how we interact with other city employees and bureaus and will take some time to adjust to our new surroundings. In preparation for the move next month, please be sure to take advantage of the upcoming purge days and be sure to take home any other personal items you may have accumulated over the years. There&rsquo;s no time like now to start packing things up.</p>
<p><strong>Data Center Move</strong> &ndash; Carolyn and her team are humming along with moving the data center to its new location. The physical environment has been built out and some non-production applications are already migrated. The migration schedule has been published and over the next several months everything will be moved out to the Brookwood site.</p>
<p><strong>Public Safety Technology Division</strong> - We launched the new Public Safety Technology Division on July 1. Much work has been going on over the past month to ensure a smooth launch. The technology support personnel for Portland Fire and Rescue, Portland Police Bureau, Portland Bureau of Emergency Management and the Bureau of Emergency Communication are now under a single unified public safety technology division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An important next step is to convene a Public Safety Steering Committee to discuss the overall governance and focus for this new Division.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m really looking forward to identifying where we can take advantage of opportunities to strategically align technology support resources within this new structure.&nbsp;Last week we held a division meeting and I want to thank those who could be there for their participation in the discussions. Excellent information we received regarding change management and the impact it has on those involved in the reorganization.</p>
<p><strong>SoT</strong> &ndash; We just received the results of the Speed of Trust Survey and are starting to work our way through all the information received. I&rsquo;m really encouraged that we had more employees take the survey this year than we did two years ago. I&rsquo;m hoping this is a good indicator that we are making progress in this effort and I want to thank those who took the time to respond and provide your comments to help us create a culture of trust within our bureau. More to come on this topic, so stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>CTO Roundtable</strong> - Later this year I will be launching a CTO roundtable where I will ask for a few volunteers to spend an hour each month with me to discuss a variety of issues from strategic initiatives, organizational alignment, automation, efficiencies and generally an open discussion on where can we continue to make improvements. It&rsquo;s a new concept so the focus may change as we dig into these various areas, but right now I&rsquo;m thinking the first group would volunteer for six months and then have another group of volunteers for a new group to participate. I&rsquo;m open to your ideas and hearing how we get the most out of this effort. For the time being, I&rsquo;m looking for volunteers who are non-manager and non-supervisor employees. If you&rsquo;re interested in being part of this first group, please let me know.</p>
<p>As always, I&rsquo;m happy to answer any questions.</p>

<p>Andrew Abudakar is a member of the Desktop Support and Deployment Team and a go-to person when I need to have my computer fixed.&nbsp; I met Andrew early 2016 when I needed big help to fix an old idle computer used for livestream Council meetings that could not be turned on, and it needed to run an urgent update that same day.&nbsp; It was missing cables, video cards, and other components which were moved in and out of the closet.&nbsp; Andrew went out of his way to gather all missing pieces and had the computer turned back on within an hour. Couldn&rsquo;t have done it without Andrew.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t end there! Andrew was an incredibly helpful when I needed an extension outlet for a dead UPS box, or when I needed a docking for my laptop to a monitor, there&rsquo;s too many occasions to list it all here.&nbsp; The things Andrew does for everyone goes unnoticed sometimes, but they sure make huge impacts!</p>
<p>In addition to the solutions he provided, Andrew&rsquo;s attitude is amazing. &nbsp;He is very patient and friendly.&nbsp; Helping others make him happy, so he does it very well.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to pass this ward on to Andrew.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/644889

<div><span style=""; font-size: small;"">Tracey Le is on the front lines of the City&rsquo;s increasingly visible eGovernment work to implement customer-facing applications. I first met Tracey nearly a decade ago when I was assigned to post content to the BTS website. She had the keys to PortlandOregon.com. It was the dawn of the custom Content Management System (CMS) and the City was leading the charge with its newly minted PortlandOnline.com system. Having come from the federal government which at the time was struggling to get static pages to display properly, the eGov team&rsquo;s CMS wizardry was truly revolutionary at that time. In the middle of this revolution was Tracey, always cheerfully unlocking the door to this new eGov world. I noticed then her dedication to working with the team to find a solution and get the job done.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style=""; font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style=""; font-size: small;"">Those responsible for maintaining City websites will appreciate Tracey&rsquo;s mastery of the City&rsquo;s CMS infrastructure, which some may find challenging to work with. Content administrators find Tracey an ever capable, patient and dedicated partner helping them leverage online tools to better communicate with citizens, customers, partners and other stakeholders across the region. This work includes:</span></div>

<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">As you may be aware at the recommendation of the <a href=""/bts/lmc"">BTS Labor Management Committee</a> our bureau has been leveraging flexible schedules and telework as ways to provide increased work-life balance, and more recently to accommodate working condition changes arising from the <a href=""/omf/71342"">Portland Building Reconstruction Project</a>.&nbsp; These alternatives are not one size fits all solutions,&nbsp;but the expanded use of these tools will allow us to use them even more effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">For more information and policies regarding BTS flexible schedules and telework please refer to <a href=""/bts/66730"">Bureau Policies</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">Initial BTS efforts with regards to the technology of implementing teleworking have focused on piloting flexible schedules and expanded telework and gathering feedback from staff experiences.&nbsp; So far feedback has been very positive. Due to that success BTS is now partnering with OMF to expand a teleworking pilot outside of BTS. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>OMF developed a telework pilot to evaluate how we can expand teleworking options for staff. The pilot has been discussed in the context of the Portland Building Reconstruction Project, but the intent is to leverage whatever we learn across bureaus, particularly because learning how to effectively and responsibly implement telework policies will be a critical piece in the City&rsquo;s effort to become an &ldquo;Employer of Choice,&rdquo; especially with the demographic shifts in our workforce over the next few years.</p>
<p>In addition to our long-term interest in telework, given the recent snow and ice events there is a desire to look at teleworking as a continuity of operations tool for some employees in cases of office closures. This pilot project gives us the opportunity to evaluate how work may be appropriately accomplished in a telework environment and will help inform us how we can successfully move the City towards more flexibility in how we work.<strong><br /></strong></p>

<p><strong>Project Status and Next Steps</strong></p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">There are roughly 100 participants spread across ten bureaus participating in the pilot, which kicked off in March and is scheduled to last 3 months, wrapping up towards the end of June. &nbsp;Although this pilot is short in duration, bureaus are encouraged to continue to pilot teleworking within their respective bureaus.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">BTS has provided project updates to the <a href=""/bts/47553"">Customer Stakeholder Group</a>&nbsp; and the OMF Business Hour group earlier this month and management seems to have a positive and optimistic view of teleworking.</p>

BTS Blog,633183,Walter’s Hill Radio Site Upgrade Project,1,,2017-03-21 18:18:18 UTC,2017-03-21 18:08:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Bob Ochs</em></p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>After the initial 800 MHZ radio was first deployed in 1992-3, there were major radio coverage problems in Gresham metro area.&nbsp; After a lot of research, the solution was to install a 5 channel site on Walter&rsquo;s Hill. The site had very limited room, but provided the necessary coverage. It was supposed to be a temporary fix, which of course became permanent.</p>
<p><img title=""old Walter's Hill building"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=633177"" alt=""old Walter's Hill building"" width=""500"" height=""310.040705563"" /></p>
<p>So finally in 2010, Scott Howes and I began the planning for the new site. We priced out a 140&rsquo; tower with communication buildings at the base; the CIP budget was $600K. We started to have neighborhood meetings and saw that it was going to get complicated very quickly which of course it did. We redesigned the site plan by changing the building to look like a home to be more conducive to the neighborhood. This defused the objection of decreased property values. After 2.5 years of many meetings and revisions, we submitted a design that included a 2,400 sf building and a 70&rsquo; tower. The land-use application was approved by City of Gresham, but then the Walter&rsquo;s Hill neighborhood association filed an appeal. After five months of planning, attorneys and a hearing, the appeal was denied. Due to the many changes and revisions, the cost of the project went from $600k to $1.13 million.</p>
<p><img title=""Walter's Hill tower foundation"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=633178"" alt=""Walter's Hill tower foundation"" width=""500"" height=""384.848484848"" /></p>
<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>
<p>We started construction in early 2016 with the low bidder, 2KG Constructors, Inc.&nbsp; Construction continued for all of 2016 and into 2017. The job was delayed by many unforeseen problems, here are some of the main issues we addressed:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;We found an old cistern right where the tower foundation was designed to go.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;The heavy spring rains delayed the site excavation. The contractor even sunk a D8 excavator in the mud. See pic.</p>
<p><img title=""excavator"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=633180"" alt=""excavator"" width=""500"" height=""348.066298343"" /></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;We found the untouched dirt behind the old house was unsuited for supporting any sizable weight load. We replace 20 truckloads mud for 20 loads of 4&rdquo; minus rock to stabilize the area.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;The soils under half of the poured slab had to be removed and replaced for the same reason (as #3).</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;We had to remove over 700 lbs. of trash dumped in a ravine just south of the old house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;The new sprinkler system design was not familiar to the install company.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;The surplus generator we planned to use had to be replace with a &ldquo;UL&rdquo; listed model, which changed the entire air ventilation and exhaust parameters.</p>
<p><strong><img title=""Walter's Hill interior"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=633182"" alt=""Walter's Hill interior"" width=""500"" height=""375"" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Current status</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are finalizing the new generator install.</li>
<li>The site is currently connected via &ldquo;T1&rsquo;s&rdquo;, a microwave path to Prune Hill is proceeding.</li>
<li>The fire system permit and the final building permit is in process.</li>
<li>Once we receive from the contractor the final liability release, retainage release, warrantee and maintenance bonds received, and final payment docs, we will close the project</li>
<li>Lessons learned will be the final step on the project.</li>

<p><em>By Ida Salazar</em></p>
<p>Penelope has led BTS in all Equity related activities for the past several years.&nbsp; This work is very meaningful and very important.&nbsp; Penelope helps both management and staff recognize that to ensure we foster the most inclusive work environment possible we have to look at how we have always done things &ndash; and change them where needed.</p>
<p>Most recently, over the past two years, Penelope has led BTS in the development of an Equity Baseline&nbsp;&ndash; this was a tremendous effort!&nbsp; BTS, along with all City Bureaus, were asked to answer 50 or more questions to establish where BTS falls on the Equity spectrum from Exclusive to Full Inclusion.&nbsp; This tools is helping the Equity Committee determine where to focus attention to begin to shift focus, specifically call out racism, and seek to eliminate racial bias.&nbsp; We all own taking part in initiatives that address institutional racism; we need to intentionally review our existing policies and practices to weed out the barriers to achieving racial equity in our lifetime.</p>
<p>Please join me in recognizing and thanking Penelope for her ongoing dedication and leadership in helping BTS develop a better environment for everyone!</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/631923

<p>I first met Joel Donaldson during my years at BOEC when he was assigned there as an analyst for a short time.</p>
<p>His professional demeanor and attendance to task was demonstrated by his fact finding and ability to ask the right questions.</p>
<p>I ran into Joel only occasionaly over the years, but would come to work with Joel directly, as he was already working on the RegJIN project when I came along.</p>
<p>I noticed the same tenacity and resoluteness to getting the job done. Joel left the RegJIN project and moved on to the Project Management Office and he was greatly missed.</p>
<p>Joel is one of many IT folks working tirelessly in the background to move City IT forward and is very deserving of the BTS Super Star Award.</p>

BTS Blog,623207,Update on the Selection of the Data Center Co-Location Facility,1,,2017-01-18 18:54:42 UTC,2017-01-09 23:56:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em><img title=""picture of servers"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=624014"" alt=""picture of servers"" width=""500"" height=""357.632933105"" /></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>By Archanaa Ananda</em></p>
<p>The overall project health for the Data Center Move (DCM) project is yellow leaning towards green. &nbsp;This is primarily because selecting the Co-Location facility (CoLo) took considerably longer than was originally planned.&nbsp; The City is aiming to complete the contract with the CoLo vendor signed by February 1, 2017 to bring the status to green. All other tasks are on schedule.</p>
<h3>The DCM project selected the CoLo facility in late November, 2016. <a href=""/bts/viawest.com"">V</a><a><strong>iaWest.com&lrm;</strong></a><strong> </strong>is situated in Hillsboro, OR, USA</h3>
<p>The primary reason for the purpose-built location within the region are:</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fault tolerant and redundant infrastructure</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Highly secure environment, access controlled and monitored 24 x 7</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data center-grade components and maintenance cycles</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scalable for future growth on demand</p>
<p>Secondary purpose-built data center for Backing up and Disaster Recovery:</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; City will continue to back up data daily in the secondary location (Colorado) provided by Viawest which is identical to the Primary Location in Hillsboro. Currently City Data is backed up at Comm Center.</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovery for critical systems, copies of backup data for others (2018)</p>
<h2>Benefits of vendor locations:</h2>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increased reliability, availability, and resilience of primary City systems</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increased security and physical monitoring</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significant savings on power and cooling</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elimination of costs associated with supporting data center infrastructure</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reclaimed floor space in Portland Building</p>
<h2>Completions:</h2>
<p>The DCM team wishes to thank all the teams such as Vertical Applications, Networking, Server teams, Database, SAP and TBC (Technology Business Consultants). These teams diligently worked towards gathering two sets of documents that are the foundation of the move. TBC did an outstanding job to connect DCM project team with their clients on timely manner.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application Vs Server inventory</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current Performance Measurements</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procurement Prioritization</p>
<h2>Current tasks</h2>
<p>DCM team is currently working on the designing the CoLo layout so that ViaWest vendor will be able to provide the facility layout for the Data Center.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the secondary site layout will be used for backing up the data. This will be later used for Disaster Recovery process, starting in 2018.</p>
<h2>Future tasks:</h2>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BOM (Build of Materials) for procurement.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detailed migration plans</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Business Requirement Document for receiving approvals from the stakeholders.</p>

<p><em>By Jeff Baer</em></p>
<p>Over the past year and a half I have had the pleasure of meeting with many of you and have heard a number of ideas about how and where we can improve our services based on industry best practices or how we can maximize information and technology within BTS.</p>
<p>I know each of you have probably spent some time thinking about how to make things better or where we can we apply technology to do something more efficiently. There are lots of good reasons for the way we have done things or why we have certain processes in place, however maybe now the timing is better to rethink them.</p>
<p>So, here's the contest: The BTS employee (or employees if you want to collaborate) who sends me the best idea for automating a process, identifies a technology application that would create efficiencies or identifies cost savings&hellip;.wins $50 cash. Keep in mind that an idea to replace a major system or application probably won&rsquo;t be at the top of the list. I&rsquo;m really looking for the easy win or low hanging fruit that can easily be implemented. Since I am the one sponsoring the contest and paying the money out of my pocket, I will be the committee to decide the winner&mdash;or winners. Of course I will seek advice from a number of people to validate the suggestion. Ideas are due by February 1.</p>
<p>Note that there is no form on which to submit your suggestion, but rather, you should <a href=""mailto:jeff.baer@portlandoregon.gov?subject=BTS Contest"">email it to me</a>.&nbsp; Be sure to provide enough information to fully understand the idea or suggestion.</p>

BTS Blog,621837,Speed of Trust at the All Hands Meeting,1,,2016-12-22 22:01:44 UTC,2016-12-22 21:33:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Brian Ventura</em></p>
<p>The FranklinCovey Speed of Trust program and training continue to make a difference for BTS. We adopted Speed of Trust in February of 2016 and now have completed training BTS staff and management. I am encouraged by the changes I witnessed over the last nine months.</p>
<p>In November, BTS held an All Hands meeting and it was a great success. I specifically want to highlight the talk regarding Speed of Trust and the difference it made for Boyd Coffee. Jeff Newman, President and CEO, and Ann Nordquist, VP of HR, from Boyd Coffee attended and spoke at our All Hands regarding their adoption of the Speed of Trust in 2010. Jeff and Ann explained they have seen drastic, positive changes in the past six years. That encourages me regarding the impact we can achieve in BTS and the City as a whole.</p>
<p>Boyd Coffee is a Portland union shop, as we are, so the Labor Management Committee was very interested in how Speed of Trust affected their environment. Boyd explained their culture was significantly divided between the office workers and the staff workers. For them, they had informal terms of &ldquo;the carpet people&rdquo; and &ldquo;the concrete people&rdquo;, referring derisively to the office management/staff and production floor staff respectively. Production workers thought management did not trust them and did not care about them. Management wanted to change this and recognized they could be put out of business due to the significant market changes and lack of coherence between employees and management.</p>
<p>Jeff and Ann adopted the Speed of Trust, with the goal of spreading trust throughout the organization. Jeff explained they started with him and the Management staff to adopt the language and transparency of the system, then brought it to the Union staff. Boyd&rsquo;s successes were great.</p>
<p>The story that stood out the most for me was around their need to streamline production. Jeff explained, the experts told them they needed a large piece of equipment that cost too much for their size and budget. They did not know what they could do to stay competitive. So through the Speed of Trust, they went to their production staff and presented the problem, explained the inability to purchase expensive machines and the concern Boyd would lose market share without a solution.</p>
<p>The production staff were surprised. They did not know how the business was run, they did not know what the market was like, and they did not know what Boyd wanted to do outside of their day-to-day jobs. The production staff came together, worked with Management and designed an innovative, lower cost solution to drastically increase production, while spending a fraction of the proposed new equipment cost. Now Management continues to engage the staff and give transparent insight into the company&rsquo;s working and goals.</p>
<p>On the union contract front, Jeff explained, they began, and continue, to complete their contract negotiations in a fraction of the time, before the contracts end, and with both Management and Union happy with the outcomes.</p>
<p>If you did not get a chance to participate directly in the All Hands and witness this yourself, then you can go to the Speed of Trust website (<a href=""http://www.speedoftrust.com/boyds_coffee"">http://www.speedoftrust.com/boyds_coffee</a>) to watch Jeff and Bob Stanley, their Union representative, talk about the impacts! The video links are toward the bottom of that posting. I encourage each of us to watch those videos as they are inspirational and a hint at what we can achieve with the Speed of Trust in BTS!</p>

<p>By the way, we asked them how the negative terms, Carpet People and Concrete People, were handled and they said they embraced the terms and made them into positive examples of what they can accomplish with Trust. To show trust and building an inclusive environment, they purchased remnant carpet pieces to put on the production floor and they took out the carpet in the entry lobby to show they were a company built on a foundation of concrete. They even told a small story about one of their longest standing employees, who was previously disenfranchised. He had previously stated he would NEVER walk on the carpet side, his distrust was that high. One day, a year after the Speed of Trust was embraced, he went to Jeff&rsquo;s office and said, &ldquo;you say you have an open door policy, is it true or just talk?&rdquo; Jeff answered that it was a true open door policy and they had an open and honest conversation, the first conversation they ever had in the many years they worked together.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/621837

<p><strong>Our first BTS Super Star &ndash; Howie Weiner</strong></p>
<p>Howie started at BOEC in 1997 working on the CAD system. In January he&rsquo;ll have been with the city for 20 years. When we needed CAD support help for RegJIN he moved over to ITD (Police IT) and took on that support role. When RegJIN&rsquo;s support needs shifted from CAD support to programming, he moved to ITD Desktop Support and mobile phone support. He then played a critical role in rolling out over a thousand smart phones (iPhones and androids) for the Police Bureau. Through all of these transitions, and during this recent simultaneous roll out and change in responsibilities, Howie has been a Super Star.</p>

<p><strong>Our first Super Star Team &ndash; Admin Support Team</strong></p>
<p>Elsa Kaufman, Michelle Ladd, Elonda Bristol, Becca Varnum, and Amy Tuttle are each an important part of our Admin Support Team. Everyone in the bureau depends on this group for critical services that help us get our job done. This group makes us better able to provide services to our customers. They are always there to make sure we have what we need to do our jobs and be successful. Things they take care of for us include, but are not limited to: payroll, phones, training, travel, and setup of our All Hands Meetings. They provide an incredible range of service. When new things come up, as they always do, they rise to the challenge every time.</p>

<p>Drones or Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely used in the hobbyists and military markets. Recently the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=86305"">released new rules</a> that went into effect August 29, 2016 around civilian drone usage. These changes will open the door for many new commercial applications, but it&rsquo;s also good to know that these rules are designed to minimize risks to other aircraft, people and property on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are captivated by the limitless possibilities unmanned aircraft offer, and they are already creating business opportunities in this exciting new field,&rdquo; said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. &ldquo;These new rules are our latest step toward transforming aviation and society with this technology in very profound ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the commercial market matures you will see more drones used in a variety of settings. As an example, we&rsquo;ve recently been working with a local drone company to determine if they could be used to provide aerial inspections of our public safety radio towers using their high definition filming capabilities. These drones have interchangeable camera and sensor capabilities, so we are interested in seeing how they could be used to visually inspect these towers.</p>
<p>You can start imagining how drones could be used in a variety of other visual inspections, such as providing eyes in the sky during certain events like traffic accident investigations, assessing a scene of a disaster, search and rescue operations and other law enforcement activities. You may even see drones tethered to police and fire vehicles and deployed during certain events.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img title=""BTS Radio techs try to minimize exposure to hazards by only climbing towers when needed"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=596386"" alt=""BTS Radio tech on tower"" width=""375"" height=""500.25"" /></p>
<p>There are many possibilities that this new and emerging market creates, but it will have to be carefully thought out as there are many safety challenges associated with their use. The FAA established the <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=86693"">Unmanned Aircraft Safety Team</a> to gather and analyze data to enhance safety and operations of drones in the nation&rsquo;s airspace.</p>
<p>Overall it will be exciting to see the variety of new ways and new markets that drones will be used in the coming years. Stay tuned.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/595702

<p>The Bureau of Technology Services Support Center Hardware Standards Panel was established last decade with the unique vision to research and recommend stable and cost effective client computing platforms and peripherals which meet the business needs of the City of Portland.&nbsp; The success of the Hardware Standards Panel is based on the facilitation of open and inclusive dialogue among support teams and customer bureau employees.&nbsp; As needed, the Panel is tasked with evaluating the various requests for specific computing hardware that bureau employees may require.&nbsp; The Panel works with the customer to establish the business need and establish the case for approving the request or determining an alternate solution that could better suit the need.</p>
<p>The panel also evaluates and recommends standard computing hardware models and platforms in order to provide excellent and timely service in deploying the equipment that City employees use every day.&nbsp; Thanks to the development and stocking of standard equipment BTS support teams are able to quickly configure and deliver workstations, monitors, laptops and selected peripherals/cables directly from in house Stores facilities.&nbsp; This removes the need for City employees to wait an extended period of time for ordering, processing and shipping that would usually happen with product procurement.</p>

<p>A good example of this standardization is the latest workstation model, the <a title=""Computer - Desktops"" href=""/bts/60679"">Dell Optiplex 7040</a>.&nbsp; Many have wondered why the size of the computer is smaller now.&nbsp; The Panel had the opportunity to avail the City of technological advancement and recommend a platform that allows for a number of key advantages.&nbsp; The smaller computers are easier to deploy.&nbsp; Due to smaller size and less weight more of them can be transported in the same vehicle.&nbsp; They are smaller and easier to put on the desk leaving leg room underneath while simultaneously not taking up much space above.&nbsp; As the City is concerned for green computing, the smaller workstations create less waste due to less packaging and less production materials.&nbsp; As an added bonus all these advantages are achieved while performance of the workstation is actually improved over that of the previous larger computers.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/596267
BTS Blog,596205,Emergency Radio System Replacement Project – Radios Go Live On New System!,1,,2016-10-28 16:30:49 UTC,2016-10-28 16:13:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Karl Larson and Mark Tanner, Co-Project Managers, PSSRP</em></p>
<p>On October 11th a limited number of public safety agencies on the east side of the county were transitioned to the new P-25 Digital Emergency Radio system. This initial transition was very successful; consequently, all other public safety/first-responder agencies within the county were transitioned to the new system just a week later. Approximately 3800 radios in total are now on the new system. About 2300 remain on the legacy analog system but will be transitioned over in the coming months.</p>
<p>As with any large &ldquo;go-live&rdquo; there have been some issues arise. Examples include:</p>
<p>* Ensuring radio users are using the correct new talk groups to participate on the digital system. (Note: The analog system remains fully functional so if the wrong channel is selected the radio transmissions are still 100% supported)</p>
<p>* The different tone and improved clarity of the voice transmissions cause some users to not recognize other users&rsquo; voices as they have in the past. This will fade as an issue as users become accustomed to the sound characteristics of the new system.</p>
<p>* Volume levels of voice transmissions are not consistent across the various user agencies. Again, this will quickly decline as radio and infrastructure settings are fine-tuned.</p>
<p>* Some in-building signal amplifiers are not yet digital-compatible and will require upgrading. BTS/Comms is upgrading these systems in City-owned facilities. Other non-City agencies are also addressing their upgrades.</p>
<p>Training bulletins, videos and demonstrations by Police and Fire representatives have been very effective in helping the large number of public safety responders understand the changes they will experience in the new digital environment.</p>
<p><em><img title=""coverage map"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=596224"" alt=""coverage map"" width=""500"" height=""273.442416614"" /></em></p>
<p>Overall, the new system is performing at and above expectations in terms of coverage and quality of service. This map shows the vendor&rsquo;s 97.5% guaranteed coverage within Multnomah County. Only 22 (red tiles) of 1064 tiles failed to meet the 97.5% threshold. Coverage in the majority of these red areas still meets operational requirements.</p>
<p>The map below shows the actual effective range of the new system, as determined by physical testing with a mobile and a portable radio. As compared to the previous map, one can see that the actual coverage is way beyond the Multnomah County boundaries.

<p>A <a title=""Explosion reported in NW Portland; 8 injured, including 3 firefighters"" href=""http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2016/10/portland_firefighters_respondi_3.html"">gas leak explosion in NW Portland</a> levels a 4 story building, severely damaging several others, and blowing out windows three blocks away. It was almost immediately called a four alarm incident.&nbsp; Three firefighters, two police officers, and three civilians were injured. When <a title=""Dispatch audio of original mayday call"" href=""https://soundcloud.com/kgw-newschannel-8/dispatch-audio-of-original-mayday-call"">a mayday call went out</a> from one of the injured firefighters, I got chills. Because of dogged dedication to resolving a reception issue, the call was heard loud and clear. Several weeks prior, communication could have been very challenging.</p>
<p>One of the more frustrating and challenging duties electronic technicians have is to identify, locate and deactivate interfering signals on the city&rsquo;s public safety radio system. During these hunts, easily 85% of the technician&rsquo;s time is spent waiting for the<strong> </strong>problem to occur, as it's almost always intermittent. The remaining time is spent scrambling to identify a direction or location before it subsides. <strong>Interference</strong> can come from ANY type of wireless (and sometimes NOT wireless!) device, such as baby monitors, closed circuit TV systems, wireless LAN and WAN systems, cable TV, etc. Sometimes completely inactive components such as coax connectors, sections of conduit, or pieces of tower structure can even generate interfering signals. I&rsquo;ve even seen interference generated by defective, but functional memory chips in a personal computer but only under certain circumstances of processor activity. The initial stages of an interference hunt are usually an exercise in patience and persistence.</p>
<p>Imagine having to locate one unique vehicle in the Portland metro area. You don&rsquo;t know where it is, when it will be moving, or what it looks like. All you know is that it makes its existence known on the area roads from time to time. And when it does, it hinders other traffic for seconds or minutes at a time, then disappears. Go find it and when you do, take the keys from the driver!</p>
<p>What follows is a true account of one of our more challenging hunts&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Sometime during the last few weeks of August, 2016</strong></p>
<p>A 911 dispatcher calls a patrol car in the downtown area over the radio, on the central talkgroup. All cars on central hear a loud burst of static, then the final portion of the dispatcher&rsquo;s call. No one responds, as the unit number being called was covered up by the static burst. The dispatcher tries again, unaware that her transmission is not getting through. The next time, it does. The unit being called responds, but all the dispatcher hears is the same loud burst of static, covering up the entire response from the patrol car. The dispatcher sees an indication on her dispatch display that the patrol car&rsquo;s radio did transmit, assumes the officer responded and proceeds with the dispatch call.</p>
<p>This scenario repeats itself over the next few hours with increasing regularity and severity. Finally, the supervisors on the dispatch floor decide it&rsquo;s time to engage the radio shop to investigate the problem. The other radio technicians, the engineering department, and I see the email from the dispatch floor and begin to monitor our radios. It&rsquo;s only a matter of minutes before we hear the problem. We recognize it by its characteristics as an interfering radio signal, intermittent and very short in duration, but there long enough to affect radio communications. The hunt for clues begins.</p>
<p>The plan is to catch the problem happening, and using directional receiving equipment, get coordinates on the point of origination from two or more locations. The point of intersection will help narrow the search to a much smaller area. Geometry at work.</p>
<p><strong>September 8th, Thursday</strong></p>
<p>I start my on-call rotation today. I'll be the one dealing with the interference when dispatch pages me during after- hours occurrences. I setup the <a href=""https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/product/pr100-productstartpage_63493-9653.html"">PR100</a> (interference detection gear) in the Suburban and hit the road at the first recurrence of trouble. This goes on for a couple days, but the signal is too short. I can't confirm what direction it&rsquo;s coming from, or even what it looks like on our detection equipment. Eventually I need to return to regular assignments and duties.</p>
<p><img title=""PR100 and antenna"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=595481"" alt=""PR100 and antenna"" width=""500"" height=""333.333333333"" /></p>
<p>A day or so later, while working at the Prune Hill (SW Camas, WA) radio site, we hear it on the radio and immediately began looking for it. Jeremy, one of the other radio techs, notices a flickering indication on the PR100 while he has it connected to the site&rsquo;s receiver system. After a few more occurrences, he confirms that the flicker is definitely the interfering signal. The indications are distributed across several frequencies, not just one. Usually this is the type of interference we see from in-building cellular telephone and two-way radio amplifiers, also known as BDA&rsquo;s (Bi-Directional Amplifiers) or DAS&rsquo;s (Distributed Antenna Systems). Great! Now we know what to look for. All we have to do is locate it.</p>
<p><strong>September 10<sup>th</sup>, Saturday</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;After a few days of mixing my regular duties with interference chasing, I have little success. Then, at 11PM, I get a page that the problem has returned, and has been constant for several minutes. I shoot out the door and head towards Prune Hill, where we first identified it. Arriving near the radio site, I pull off the road and start up the detection gear. As I sit listening patiently, I hear several instances on the radio. But not once do I see the indications on the detection gear. Hmmm&hellip;I need to relocate. It's obviously strong enough SOMEWHERE to interfere with radio traffic.</p>
<p>A little after 1:00 AM I decide to head into Portland. I drive to Mt. Scott (SE Portland), and then to Council Crest (SW Portland) because they both afford a panoramic radio&rsquo;s-eye view of the whole metro area. The occurrences have lessened considerably by 2:00. With only a 1 or 2-second window of presence, it is nearly impossible to capture on the detection gear, let alone get a direction to its source. Sitting&hellip;waiting&hellip;listening&hellip;sipping Mountain Dew, the on-call tech&rsquo;s best friend! Well, mine anyway. 4:00 approaches, and I&rsquo;ve heard no instances for over an hour. So I call it a night and go home.</p>
<p><strong>September 12<sup>th</sup>, Monday</strong></p>
<p>As the reports increase and the problem seems more intrusive, the decision is made for me to devote my entire shift to resolving the issue. I'm somewhat relieved, and at the same time a bit apprehensive. I know that the extra time hunting will help to identify and locate it, but at the same time the expectation for a resolution will also increase.</p>
<p>My days now consist of turning on the radio and PR100 detection equipment as soon as I get into the Suburban in the morning and heading into the downtown area. Prune Hill has been unproductive for locking onto the signal. Alarms generated by the radio system seem to indicate it is coming from the downtown area.</p>
<p><img title=""PR100 screen"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=595485"" alt=""PR100 screen"" width=""500"" height=""281.25"" /></p>
<p><strong>September 14<sup>th</sup>, Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>Two more days have gone by with little progress. The occurrences have been much shorter than usual lately, maybe only affecting one or two radio transmissions, then nothing for two or more hours. It seems the harder I search, the more elusive the interference gets. It's very frustrating. I thought I would have found it by now. Several days have been devoted to hunting it.</p>
<p>We contacted our neighboring public safety agencies to see if they have been having the same issues. Washington County reports they too have been getting hit by it. So, it's affecting both sides of the West Hills. I decide to set up at our Council Crest radio site for the day. It affords a good view to both downtown Portland, and into Beaverton. It has also been the site most consistent in logging interference alarms on the radio system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful day, so I set up in a shady spot in the park. Fifteen minutes into my vigil I'm rewarded with a particularly long episode of interference, some <em>10-15 minutes in duration</em>. I quickly tune the PR100 to the frequencies we were checking at Prune Hill and immediately see the flickering, barely-there indications. As I swing the directional antenna full circle, I manage to lock the seemingly strongest indication coming from a north-northeasterly direction. Maybe the NW industrial area, but nothing from the Washington county area. Now, if I can just get another heading locked in from another location. The PR100 has the wonderful ability to triangulate two such directions (vectors) and display the approximate location on a GPS-synced map.</p>
<p><img title=""GPS-synced map of triangulated vectors"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=595476"" alt=""GPS-synced map of triangulated vectors"" width=""500"" height=""333.333333333"" /></p>
<p>I spend the rest of my day parked on Willamette Boulevard in North Portland, giving me a good clear view over the NW and Swan Island industrial areas. I can get a good second vector from here but the interference has subsided for the day.</p>
<p>Finally, after over two weeks, some noteworthy progress!! I am encouraged. This may be a winnable battle yet.</p>
<p><strong>September 16<sup>th</sup>, Friday</strong></p>
<p>Two days of hunting from Willamette Boulevard have been unproductive. The familiar indications are so weak, if even visible on the PR100, that getting a solid direction isn't possible. The momentary bursts that occur every couple hours are not helping the effort. I don&rsquo;t understand. When at Council Crest, the equipment indicated it was coming from this direction. Yet I can barely see it here. The one or two best indications I get are in a direction that doesn&rsquo;t even intersect with the vector I saw at Council Crest. Now the signals seem to be coming from downtown, maybe east of the Willamette River.</p>
<p>I spend the remainder of the day on a hilltop near Powell and McLoughlin, sitting, waiting. But again, the bursts are too short to be useful. It seems to be coming from somewhere to the North. I end my shift frustrated, again wondering if I will ever find the source.</p>
<p><strong>September 17<sup>th</sup>, Saturday</strong></p>
<p>My pager lights up around 8 PM. Here we go again. Until 3 AM the next morning, I drive to various locations. I try desperately to get a direction on the interference from ANYWHERE around or East of the downtown area. Once again, the bursts are too short.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m driving about, I take some comfort in the fact that the early morning hours are great for interference hunting. I have the roads and highways all to myself. No traffic to deal with, no one behind me honking as I roll slowly down the street with an antenna out the window. I can pull a U-turn wherever I want, just turn on the vehicle strobes and proceed. I can and did, drive down I-84 Westbound at about 25 MPH at one time. Once, when I picked up a fairly strong indication on the detection gear, I was able to safely shoot across all three freeway lanes to take an exit that was imminent.</p>
<p>I noticed while moving down I-5 South to I-84 East that the ramp to I-84 would be a good place to sit on my next outing. There is ample room to pull over out of daytime traffic and get a good path and view of the central downtown area, both sides of the river. I decide to give it a try, desperate to make some sort of progress. My &ldquo;perch&rdquo; on the I-84 Eastbound ramp has provided the strongest indications yet. Unfortunately, the signal seems to be coming from all directions. I must be close, close enough that I don&rsquo;t have any directivity on the interference.</p>
<p><img title=""antenna looking for the signal"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=595492"" alt=""antenna looking for the signal"" width=""500"" height=""333.333333333"" /></p>
<p><strong>September 26, Monday &ndash; A breakthrough</strong></p>
<p>The reports of interference have tapered off, possibly due to the radio system users just dealing with the bursts when they occur, and possibly cooler weather moving in. High temperatures often aggravate these issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sitting and waiting for the occurrences has proven futile. The duration is just too short to confirm a direction. I&rsquo;ve decided to drive to the locations (very few) in the area where I know there is a BDA installation, and hopefully just be in the right neighborhood when the interference occurs. I am running out of time and patience.</p>
<p>Ed Connolly, one of our system engineers, has suggested an apartment complex in the area that he knows has a BDA system. It's about 10 blocks straight east of the I-84 ramp. I get no results from that location. The PR100 is still showing indications but much weaker and still pointing back to the I-84 ramp area. The occurrences subside for the day. So I head home, more frustrated than ever.</p>
<p>Around 5 PM, just after I get home, the pager goes off. Dejected and hungry, I head back into town. My destination will be the I-84 ramp. As I am listening to the radio on my way there, the interference is making its presence known in a big way. I cringe every time I hear it, feeling the mounting pressure to find and eliminate it.</p>
<p>I sit on the side of the ramp for about half an hour, waving the directional antenna about wildly during each burst, trying to get a direction. I try different directional antennas, and different detection gear. Except for the variances in test equipment, the results are always the same, strong indications in all directions.</p>
<p>To be seemingly so close, yet still no idea where it&rsquo;s coming from pushes my frustration up further. I pull the antenna back into the vehicle to give my arm a rest. I consider throwing in the towel and suggesting another tech take over. Sometimes a fresh set of eyes and perspective are all it takes. I glare hatefully at the PR100 and its dancing, flickering indications. Things are getting personal now. I think to myself, &ldquo;This interference is trying to get me fired!&rdquo; I lean back, take a breath, remind myself that all my data thus far must have a logical explanation, and focus my attention on the PR100 again.</p>
<p>Using some of the analytical abilities of the PR100, I manage to isolate the strongest indications to a frequency very near to the radio system&rsquo;s control channel. This channel is used by the central controller, the brains and &ldquo;traffic cop&rdquo; of the radio system. Everything a radio does is communicated to the central controller via the control channel: keying up, roaming to a different coverage area, even changing channels (or &ldquo;talkgroups&rdquo;, as they are called in this type of radio system).</p>
<p><img title=""controller for a radio site"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=595502"" alt=""controller for a radio site"" width=""281"" height=""499.555555556"" /></p>
<p>I narrow the PR100&rsquo;s receiver down to just the control channel, and watch for indications I can glean more clues from. I watch the various data bursts from the radios scattered about the area on the screen, along with the occasional interference burst. Before long, I notice something. The interference is NEVER present prior to a radio transmission; only immediately after a data burst from a radio. Not all of them, only the data bursts from what seems to be nearby radios. This again indicates something is going on in the area near my location. I wonder if the interference is actually being triggered by the local data bursts from nearby radios. I change the talkgroup on the mobile radio in the Suburban and watch the PR100. Right on cue, immediately after my radio&rsquo;s data burst is transmitted, there was the interference indication! I try again several times to verify my theory with the same results. I can actually force the problem to happen! &nbsp;What a huge breakthrough. This is the best finding I've made since I started hunting.</p>
<p>I call the 911 dispatch supervisor to let them know I am going to trigger the interference for the next several minutes. I'm close to locating it and this will help immensely. After about 45 minutes of channel changing and driving in four different directions in that area, I find myself at the intersection of SE 10<sup>th</sup> and Ankeny. The indications here are almost off the scale when pointed at an apartment building on the northeast corner, ""The Lofts at Lower Burnside"". The office is dark. I'll be back first thing tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>The next day I head right over and conduct a floor by floor walkthrough using the detection gear. Indications are strongest on the 6<sup>th </sup>(top) floor. The leasing agent gives me access to the only communications room she&rsquo;s aware of, but it's a dead end. Closer, but still no luck. She informs me that maintenance and management crews will both be there the next day. I promised to return the next morning.</p>
<p><strong>September 28, 2016 &ndash; Success!</strong></p>
<p>I meet the maintenance person and toured the building. Our first destination - the roof. The presence of any kind of antennas provide additional clues. Emerging through the access hatch, the first thing I notice is a &ldquo;yagi&rdquo; antenna, a highly directional, energy-multiplying type of antenna pointed directly at the Council Crest radio site. Aiming the PR100&rsquo;s directional antenna, I change channels on my portable radio and see a flood of radiated interference come from the building antenna. I&rsquo;ve got you now, my pretty, I think to myself.</p>
<p><img title=""suspect Yagi antenna"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=595489"" alt=""suspect Yagi antenna"" width=""281"" height=""499.555555556"" /></p>
<p>I ask where the antenna cable runs to. &ldquo;Probably one of the comm closets&rdquo; he responds. We go to the 4<sup>th</sup> floor where I am shown a utility closet I hadn't visited. Anticipation builds. I'm eager to see what&rsquo;s on the other side of the door. My search may soon be over.</p>
<p>As we step into the room, we are greeted by a wave of +90&deg; heat, surprising given that it&rsquo;s only in the 70&rsquo;s outside. We scan the room for the corrugated coax antenna cable. We find it dropping through the ceiling and disappearing into an enclosed cabinet that has been jammed into the tight sauna-like room. Opening the cabinet, we find several backup power supply units at the bottom of the rack, their fans straining to move the excessive heat. Halfway up is a beige metal enclosure connected to a small networking device and to the corrugated coax. It&rsquo;s noticeably hot to the touch and bears a label identifying it as a type of radio signal booster. It was obvious that this was the device causing the problem. After a few minutes&rsquo; discussion with the maintenance man, we decide it's not critical building communications equipment. I turn its power switch off and step back into the hallway. As I switch channels on my radio, I am delighted to see on my test gear a clean spectrum after each data burst from my portable radio. Finally, after over a month of persistent, incremental progress, I&rsquo;ve found it. If I didn&rsquo;t have to maintain a professional composure, I&rsquo;d break into a happy dance!</p>
<p>Upon reflection, all the odd and conflicting data I had collected now made sense. Once I had collected enough information about signal strength and direction, I was in the neighborhood. All I needed was that extra bit of control to zero in on it. This was certainly one of the toughest ones to track down, and an excellent learning experience.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/595475

<p>Over the course of the past year, the Police Bureau and the BTS Police IT support group have been working together along with the BTS Communications Division and Verizon Wireless to prepare for a deployment of Apple iPhones throughout the Police Bureau.</p>
<p>The large scale deployment of 983 Apple iPhone 6's began on August 8<sup>th</sup> and was completed on September 6<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; We also deployed 52 Android phones.&nbsp; All 1035 phones are managed and controlled under the Mobile Data Management system, <a href=""http://www.air-watch.com/"">Airwatch</a>.&nbsp; We are also using Mobile VPN through <a href=""https://www.netmotionsoftware.com/"">NetMotion</a>.&nbsp; This deployment of 1035 phones ran 3 days a week, Tuesday through Thursday for five weeks.&nbsp; This was the culmination of a yearlong effort.</p>
<p><img title=""picture of iPhone"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=594073"" alt=""picture of iPhone"" width=""250"" height=""260.135135135"" /></p>
<p>Highlights of the project include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of unprecedented secure mobile technology, Airwatch,</li>
<li>Development of a deployment process that necessitated less than a quarter of the time normally required by professional consumer vendors,</li>
<li>Development and implementation of a tool used by callout units to securely share information,</li>
<li>Development of a comprehensive sustainment and support plan that included multiple city and non-city groups,</li>
<li>Development of a process to conduct functional, security, and fiscal reviews of mobile application requests,</li>
<li>Approving and implementing 43 of 56 application requests,</li>
<li>Training of all Police Bureau members, including preparing administrators for front line support,</li>
<li>Overcoming technical issues that originated from non-city entities that would have otherwise been detrimental to the success of the project, and</li>
<li>Assisting Gresham Police Department in developing a similar project.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mobile technology deployed has already proven invaluable to sworn on the street, allowing them to perform nearly all technical-related duties typically performed inside a precinct or in a patrol car.&nbsp; On the first day Police Central Precinct received their phones, a report of a subject who walked away from an inmate work crew was broadcast.&nbsp; Using their newly issued smart phones, officers received a picture of the subject and were easily able to review the picture on their phones. Officers were then able to show the picture to members of the community who positively identified the subject. This resulted in information that the subject had left a park and entered a hospital.&nbsp; Sergeants on the street were able to get the video pictures of the subject from the hospital and send these pictures to all officers within hours of the subject walking away.&nbsp; The subject was later obtained and arrested in Lane County.</p>

BTS Blog,591729,What's Going On With the Data Center Move?,1,,2016-09-28 22:06:53 UTC,2016-09-23 19:53:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Valerie Perkinson</em></p>
<p>The Data Center Move Project comprises the moving of all infrastructure hardware, except telecom, out of the Portland Building Data Center prior to the beginning of TPB construction. The Portland Data Center will be moved to a Co-location facility, which has yet to be chosen.&nbsp; The Data Center will not be brought back to TPB after renovation, but will remain at the Co-location facility.</p>
<p><strong>Why are we moving the Data Center?</strong></p>
<p>The TPB renovation project is driving the completion date, as we want all of the servers out of the building prior to the start of construction.&nbsp; However, this is not the primary factor driving the move.&nbsp; The move to a co-location facility will also provide increased reliability for the City&rsquo;s critical applications.&nbsp; This is achieved by providing for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power redundancies</li>
<li>Cooling redundancies</li>
<li>Cable Management</li>
<li>24/7 staffing</li>
<li>Increased security</li>
<li>A platform for Disaster Recovery</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a Co-Location (COLO) Center?</strong></p>
<p>Co-location (COLO) facilities have become a prevalent method in which many private sector and government entities manage their data centers.&nbsp; COLO facilities are a type of data center where equipment, space and bandwidth are available to rent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the outside, COLO centers look like typical corporate buildings.&nbsp; However, the interiors of the buildings are quite impressive.&nbsp; They contain secure suites and/or cages for client data centers, two sets of backup generators, two sets of air conditioners, fire protection, and cable management.&nbsp; COLO facilities also provide &ldquo;remote hands&rdquo; (someone available 24/7 to mount or power on/off a server).&nbsp; Many COLO facilities also offer server management services.</p>
<p>COLO facilities are known for their incredible security.&nbsp; The exterior of the buildings are gated with a 24/7 security guard on duty.&nbsp; All vehicles are stopped at the gate.&nbsp; Upon entering the building, photo IDs must be shown and clients are escorted to their server areas.</p>
<p>COLO facilities provide a superior environment for a data center.&nbsp; With 24/7 monitoring and redundant cooling and power, most business entities cannot staff or finance this type of data center.&nbsp; The City&rsquo;s data center and its critical applications will realize less down-time at a significantly lower cost.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing the City&rsquo;s Co-Location Facility</strong></p>
<p>The City engaged a neutral, third-party, computer center firm (who will not be bidding) to analyze the existing 3<sup>rd</sup> floor data center at TPB and provide recommendations on what should be included in the RFP.&nbsp; This study was completed in May 2016.&nbsp; The City released the RFP on September 7, 2016 and it will close on September 30, 2016.&nbsp; It will take 3 to 4 weeks to review the RFP responses, conduct site visits, score the RFPs and award the bid.&nbsp; The selection process should be completed by the end of October 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Migration Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Once the WAN (Wide Area Network) is extended to the new COLO facility, the existing data center on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor of TPB and the COLO data center will operate as one data center.&nbsp; Data can then be replicated across the network.&nbsp; The City&rsquo;s servers are approximately 84% virtualized, however, there are some physical servers that will need to be moved.&nbsp; Once all the testing is complete, a phased cut-over will take place.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule</strong></p>
<p>The below schedule will change as we solidify the dates for the COLO selection, WAN availability and TPB renovation dates.&nbsp; The dates displayed below are estimates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img title=""data center move schedule"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=591730"" alt=""data center move schedule"" width=""500"" height=""214.477211796"" /></p>
<p><strong>Bureau&rsquo;s Participation</strong></p>
<p>The Data Center Move project needs the Bureau&rsquo;s participation in the following 4 areas:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><br />1. Application Inventory</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><br />&bull; All Server based applications are currently being inventoried. Vertical Application Team members, TBCs and BTS representatives are in the process of contacting each Bureau to find out Application and dependency information.<br />&bull; When will this take place? Between now and November 2016.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><br />2. Current Performance Measurements</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><br />&bull; Measurements on how critical applications are performing now are being taken.<br />&bull; This information will be used for:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;""><br />o Before the move</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;""><br />&raquo; User Acceptance Testing</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;""><br />&raquo; Troubleshooting, if necessary</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;""><br />o After the move</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;""><br />&raquo; COLO Facility Support</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><br />&bull; When will this take place? Between now and November 2016.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><br />&emsp;<br />3. User Acceptance Testing</p>

BTS Blog,587704,Working to Improve Trust in Our Working Relationships,1,,2016-09-28 22:06:43 UTC,2016-09-01 22:26:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Dan Bauer, BTS Deputy Director</em></p>
<p>At our last BTS all-staff meeting the Labor Management Committee (LMC) presented the BTS Trust Survey results and led an open conversation to ideas to improve bureau trust in our working relationships.&nbsp; Out of that idea generation several key themes emerged and I am writing to provide an update on work done by the LMC and others on those items.&nbsp; The top four items from the idea generation and&nbsp;a status of actions to date are included below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pilot a training and professional development program</strong>
<ul>
<li>Status: The BTS LMC has partnered with Franklin Covey to host courses for staff using the program based on the book &ldquo; The Speed of Trust&rdquo;&nbsp; Under this partnership we have had over 90 BTS team members attend the course.&nbsp; There has been an overwhelming positive feedback regarding the course and its relevance to our professional and personal lives.&nbsp; A testament to the high level of interest is that our 3<sup>rd</sup> class of 50 seats schedule for July 20th was completely filled in approximately 8 hours after the email was sent out to solicit attendance.&nbsp; Other updates on this item include:
<ul>
<li>Regular discussions (called Trust Huddles) are taking place in many team meetings across BTS.&nbsp; These discussions delve deeper into the course materials and can help transition from classroom learning to cultural change.</li>
<li>Several LMC members have stepped forward to become certified to teach the &ldquo;Speed of Trust&rdquo; course such that we can continue to provide this valuable experience to new staff as part of our onboarding practices.</li>
<li>A fourth Speed of Trust course will be held in September after the summer vacation season.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professional Development resources</strong>
<ul>
<li>Status:&nbsp; The BTS LMC has engaged Franklin Covey to provide professional development resources.&nbsp; This is via the newly released All Access Pass which provides learning content on the 23 curriculum areas.&nbsp; This will be rolled in the coming weeks.&nbsp; A short video of the All Access Pass is available here: <a href=""http://www.franklincovey.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AAP-Say-Hello.htm"">http://www.franklincovey.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AAP-Say-Hello.htm</a>.&nbsp; Additionally BTS is committed to providing access to the ACM <a href=""http://www.acm.org/"">http://www.acm.org/</a> membership and learning resources.&nbsp; Via ACM&rsquo;s digital library staff have access to thousands&nbsp; of technical books, webinars and pre-certification curriculum to further professional development.&nbsp; The LMC is also supportive of the COPPEA Professional Development fund as an additional avenue for professional development resources for COPPEA staff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore opportunities for employee recognition</strong>
<ul>
<li>Status:&nbsp; The&nbsp; BTS LMC has formed a subcommittee to look at ways to enhance employee recognition.&nbsp; Additionally to encourage recognition BTS Thank You cards are available at The Portland building, the 1900 building and the Communications Center.&nbsp; These cards are an easy and meaningful way to provide a hand written thank you to coworkers or customers.&nbsp; Over the last few months several hundred of these have already been used to recognize and thank our coworkers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quarterly CTO/DCTO meetings with staff at the 1900 building and Communications Center</strong>
<ul>
<li>Status:&nbsp; Jeff and Dan have begun periodic meetings with teams at locations other than the Portland building.&nbsp; These will continue as both Jeff and Dan are committed to providing opportunities to meet directly with teams to listen, share information, and create transparency with all staff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the LMC continues to fulfill its mission to improve employee satisfaction, productivity and efficiency by promoting trust, fairness and open communication between Labor and Management we are always welcome to receive feedback and ideas from our dedicated and talented employees.&nbsp; We encourage you to visit the LMC website to learn more about our activities: <a href=""/bts/lmc"">http://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/lmc</a></p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/587704
BTS Blog,587706,One Year Later on Trust -- Where Are We?,1,,2016-09-28 22:07:09 UTC,2016-09-01 22:26:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Brian Ventura, Information Security</em></p>
<p>The Speed of Trust (SoT) adventure started more than a year ago, but most of BTS had their first introduction with the Trust Survey in May/June 2015. Prior to that date, the BTS LMC started talking about new issues to tackle around September 2014. At that time, we discussed complaints and concerns to find out if there was a core issue we could address across BTS. Many of these issues had a common thread or root cause, which we started to identify as Trust, or lack of trust. We identified FranklinCovey&rsquo;s Speed of Trust program and LMC members went to a &frac12; day SoT seminar. From this review, we agreed their program is a good way to address issues within BTS. One key takeaway from the seminar was: this is an ongoing process, not a train once and we are fixed. The LMC committed to following through with the process.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" title=""Speed of Trust seminar, Feburary 2016"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=588353"" alt=""Speed of Trust seminar, Feburary 2016"" width=""500"" height=""281"" /></p>
<p>The first engagement was the survey in May 2015. The survey gave us an eye-opening or distinct view of the trust levels in BTS. We decided an external survey would give us an objective view. We saw there were significant trust taxes within BTS. We presented these results to BTS at the All Hands meeting that Fall. We also asked for feedback at the All Hands meeting and received a great list of recommendations! I will talk about those in a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February this year, Management and the LMC labor members attended the 2-day, <em>Leading at the Speed of Trust</em>, training. This was a great event, with some excellent conversation. This group identified the highest impact SoT card, affecting BTS. We identified &ldquo;Create Transparency&rdquo; as a weakness and Management agreed to focus on Creating Transparency in BTS.</p>
<p>Part of the Speed of Trust program is to participate or lead trust huddles in team meetings. Management took on this task and led their teams through the weekly trust huddle program. How far along is your team? The goal of these trust huddles is to keep the conversation open and identify areas we can make a difference in our work: apply the program to real issues in your team or between your team and another.</p>
<p>In May, the first <em>Speed of Trust Foundation</em> training was held for staff. This group got a special treat at the World Trade Center, since all the meeting rooms at the Portland Building were booked. The World Trade Center had some excellent food. This session had approximately&nbsp;forty BTS staff members and introduced the material. It went through similar exercises as the Leadership training, allowing staff to get a great view of the Speed of Trust program. Again, we had great participation and ideas flow from the event.</p>
<p>July brought us our second Foundation training, at the Communications Center.&nbsp;Fifty BTS staff members participated in the training and came away with excellent insight on how to impact the BTS culture and make this a great place to work. During this training, we introduced the FranklinCovey All-Access pass! This allows BTS employees to have on demand access to over&nbsp;fifty courses provided by FranklinCovey, including Speed of Trust. This included Impact Journeys to enhance our knowledge and practice in the Speed of Trust. Don&rsquo;t know about All-Access, but you went to training? We have you covered. We have upcoming brown-bag lunches to introduce the All-Access and provide Impact Journeys! Keep your eyes open for the announcement. This group received royal treatment with burgers and hot dogs grilled onsite by Jeff and Dan!! They also had a waffle breakfast catered by a local favorite food cart! Great food again. We will have to see what culinary treats the final training provides.</p>
<p>We have one more Foundation training coming up in September. If you have not attended yet, this is your opportunity. We anticipate getting the remaining staff through this training. After that, we can take this to the next level! This training will be in the 1900 building. Watch for the invite! Further, a number of LMC members volunteered to become Speed of Trust Facilitators, to provide ongoing training opportunities for new staff over the years.</p>
<p>What about those recommendations from the All Hands meeting? What did the LMC do with those? Well, we started working on those, in-between and in conjunction with the Speed of Trust program. Dan has a write-up on the status and here is a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional Development - BTS engaged with FranklinCovey on their full line of on demand courses, pushed the use of ACM.</li>
<li>Recognition - The LMC tasked the Recognition Committee to discuss options with workgroups and provide recommendations.</li>
<li>Transparency - A commitment from Jeff and Dan to have quarterly CTO/DCTO meetings</li>
<li>These are just a few things. More to come.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are BTS. Your help is needed. Take on the Speed of Trust; look to your&nbsp;four cores. Is there someone you need to restore trust with? Is there someone to whom&nbsp;you could extend Smart Trust? In what behaviors are you strong? Weak? How can you work on strengthening these?</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/587706
BTS Blog,587708,Public Safety Radio Upgrade Project,1,,2016-09-28 22:07:04 UTC,2016-09-01 22:26:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>By Mark Tanner, Public Safety&nbsp;Systems Revitalization Program</em> <em>Radio Project Manager &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" title=""radio tower"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=587709"" alt=""radio tower"" width=""250"" height=""376"" /></p>
<p>Over the past several years there has been a large, complex communications project making significant progress within the City.&nbsp; The Public Safety Systems Revitalization Program (PSSRP) team, in close collaboration with the BTS Communications (Radio) group, has been engaged in replacing the mission-critical Emergency Radio System that services all of the public safety agencies that operate within the Multnomah County borders.&nbsp; The City of Portland's non-public safety bureaus also rely on this system for radio service.</p>
<p>At a cost of over $50M, the legacy analog radio system is being replaced with state-of-the-art Motorola digital <em>P-25 compliant</em> technology.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;P-25&rdquo;??&nbsp; The long name is &ldquo;APCO Project 25&rdquo; and is explained in the graph below.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s basically a way to make sure public safety agencies in a given region can all communicate.<img class=""content-right"" title=""digital radio vs. analog radio"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=588357"" alt=""digital radio vs. analog radio"" width=""250"" height=""145"" /></p>
<p>There are well over 6000 radios of various types registered on the system.&nbsp; As shown here, the majority are those used by City bureaus, especially Police and Fire.&nbsp; However, there are actually over 60 agencies that utilize this system, including school districts, universities, federal agencies, private companies and other municipalities.</p>
<p>The system provides radio coverage to the service area through a network of 14 radio towers.&nbsp; The towers are located in various upper elevation locations in and around the county.&nbsp; Each tower site has back-up power and equipment redundancy in order to support the mission-critical requirements of the system.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s interesting to note that it is estimated that approximately 85 towers would be required to cover this same area&nbsp;for cellular phone service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The radio systems of Clark County, Washington, Clackamas County, and Washington County are also being upgraded to P25 Digital standards.&nbsp; Once all systems are complete, the coverage footprint for these systems will extend from as far north as Cowlitz County, Washington to as far south as Salem, Oregon, and provide interoperability and mutual aid communications.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" title=""map of user agencies"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=588354"" alt=""map of user agencies"" width=""500"" height=""312"" /></p>
<p>The new hand-held and vehicle radios being provided to the City's radio users match the new infrastructure when it comes to features and reliability.&nbsp; For example, the hand-held radio that Portland Fire now uses offers the following features and characteristics:</p>
<p><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Display: Top and front</li>
<li>&nbsp;Keypad: Full or None</li>
<li>&nbsp;Emergency button: Programmable</li>
<li>&nbsp;Weight (with standard battery): 16.4 oz</li>
<li>&nbsp;Dimensions H x W x D (with standard battery): 5.47 x 2.98 x 1.6 inches</li>
<li>&nbsp;Large knobs to accommodate gloved-hand control</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img class=""content-right"" title=""digital radio"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=588356"" alt=""digital radio"" width=""250"" height=""250"" />Radio Features</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>The system is set to be in full use by the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 2016.&nbsp; All radio users will have the advantage of all that &ldquo;P25&rdquo; offers in this system, with additional capacity and enhanced abilities to communicate.</p>
<p>While the Radio Project installation phase winds down in 2016, there are additional enhancements that will be brought on line in 2017.&nbsp; A digital connection known as WAVE will be activated and will allow certain users to access the radio system through their own cell phones, giving a much broader footprint and coverage for radio system users.&nbsp; While not &ldquo;mission critical&rdquo; voice, it will allow non-critical, routine radio traffic to be transmitted and received anywhere cell coverage is available and will work across the United States and Canada.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/article/587708

<p class=""paragraph"">The BTS Recognition Committee is a new group formed by the&nbsp;LMC to create new opportunities for everyone in the bureau to show their appreciation for the great things we do for our customers and each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to provide you with a variety of ways to recognize individuals and groups as well as have the spotlight shown on what you do.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""paragraph""><strong>What We Are Doing</strong></p>
<p class=""paragraph"">We have gotten a group of BTS staff together to brainstorm ideas, and then have gone out to staff meetings at&nbsp;different workgroups and work sites to see what people thought about them.&nbsp; We want to find ways to recognize your work in a way that fits your personality, so we talked a lot about not just things that people liked but also ones they don&rsquo;t like.&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on that feedback we are starting with a first effort:&nbsp;an award that is passed from one employee to another to in&nbsp;appreciation&nbsp;of their help&nbsp;or customer service. &nbsp; &nbsp;Think of it like an IT themed Stanley Cup &ndash; you get to display it &nbsp;or even show it off during a ticker tape parade and then it goes to the next deserving individual after a month.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Look for more efforts to follow based on your feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
